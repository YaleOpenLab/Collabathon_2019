<h1>First Nationally Determined Contribution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the fight against Climate Change and its effects</h1>
<p>July 2017</p>
<h2>A.-Presentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since its foundation, our country has grown on the ideals of freedom, justice, independence, democracy and inclusion; oriented to the reduction of inequities and the empowerment of the peoples. The struggle of Venezuela for the independence of the colonial powers extended to five countries, under the conviction of the right and duty of the people to choose their own destiny from justice and solidarity coexistence. That fight still continues.</li>
<li>Simón Bolívar, recognized as the father of the Venezuelan homeland, defined an anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist American geopolitics; left traced the fundamental conceptual elements, the categories of what is a geopolitical thesis that we claim 200 years later: the need to build the balance of nations, a world of justice, a world of peace.</li>
<li>We are convinced and convinced that capitalist values such as consumerism, individualism and unlimited growth are the basis of the enormous social, political and environmental crisis that our civilization is going through. In the words of Comandante Chávez: "Capitalism, the capitalist economy, ends up destroying the environment, destroying society, destroying the planet. The capitalist economy is the fundamental cause of the destruction that exists today on the planet, of the great natural, climatic imbalances that have broken the balance on Earth. " "It is practically and ethically inadmissible to sacrifice the human species by insanely invoking the validity of a socio-economic model with a galloping destructive capacity. It is suicidal to insist on disseminating it and imposing it as an infallible remedy for the evils of which it is,</li>
<li>Capitalist values must be replaced by values based on justice, equity, solidarity, community life, harmony with the nature of which we are a part and respect for their cycles, respect for the spirituality of the people; and respect for indigenous and peasant values and knowledge. In other words, they must be replaced by ecosocialist values. We believe that our societies must change and that this transformation can only occur from the roots, from the participation, actions and knowledge of grassroots social groups and organizations, from justice, equity, respect and inclusion.</li>
<li>Venezuela has taken on the challenge of transformation. We are eco-socialists, by conviction of spirit and reason. We affirm our commitment to the construction of an alternative model of development and our unwavering will to work shoulder to shoulder with all those who want to accept the responsibility that the peoples of the world have given us. As President Nicolás Maduro Moros affirmed in the Assembly of the United Nations, we believe necessary a new concept, a new world as a need of humanity; a geopolitics of respect for peoples, for identity; a policy of coexistence; a peace policy with justice, with equality; a policy that rejects any attempt to impose the will of one country over another; be it through the threat and use of force, or through financial, economic, cultural and political means.</li>
<li>Our Constitution, passed in a popular referendum in 1999, enshrines Environmental Rights and is a pioneer in establishing that "it is a right and duty of each generation to protect and maintain the environment for the benefit of itself and the future world. Everyone has the individual and collective right to enjoy a life and a safe, healthy and ecologically balanced environment. The State will protect the environment, biological diversity, genetic resources, ecological processes, national parks and natural monuments and other areas of special ecological importance. The genome of living beings can not be patented, and the law that refers to bioethical principles will regulate the matter. It is a fundamental obligation of the State, with the active participation of society,</li>
<li>The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation, approved as a National Law in 2013, shows our will to transform the country and contribute to saving life on the planet towards a just and sustainable world; organized on the basis of truly democratic international institutions; and oriented to the supreme lasting social happiness and the Good Living.</li>
<li>By developing the constitutional principles, Venezuela has reviewed, updated and strengthened its legal framework promoting an equitable, just and effective socio-environmental management. An example of this is the revolutionary Seeds Law (2015). The purpose of this Law is "to preserve, protect, guarantee the production, multiplication, conservation, free movement and use of the seed, as well as the promotion, research, innovation, distribution and exchange of the same, from a socialist agroecological vision, privileging the national production of seeds, with special emphasis on the valuation of indigenous, Afro-descendant, peasant and local seed, contrary to patents and breeder's right on seed, prohibiting the release, use, multiplication,</li>
<li>Climate Change is one of the biggest problems currently affecting the planet, a situation that transcends the environment and must be considered in its ethical, economic, social and political dimensions. It is, in fact, one of the clearest manifestations of the crisis of capitalism as a predatory system that makes a healthy, full, solidary and peaceful life on earth impossible.</li>
<li>The fight against Climate Change materializes in effect the confrontation between two models and worldviews. The developed countries seek to perpetuate the hegemonic schemes that favor them, strengthening the patterns of consumption, production, control, domination and markets that enrich their dominant elites. Developing countries demand the right to eradicate poverty and choose their own forms of development without suffering the consequences and burdening the burden generated by the unsustainable levels of consumption of the so-called developed countries.</li>
<li>This struggle has many facets, one of which is being developed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. What is being negotiated there goes far beyond actions for mitigation or adaptation: future power relations based on the use and distribution of energy and the natural elements that will mark the hegemonic structures of the future are being negotiated.</li>
<li>The strategy to combat climate change must be effective but also fair and equitable. That is, it must consider the historical responsibilities and contribute to diminishing the inequalities that negatively affect numerous countries and social groups, not to deepen them. The principles and commitments recognized by all the signatory countries of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change establish ethical and practical bases in this regard, particularly with regard to common but differentiated responsibilities and the priorities that development and eradication of poverty for developing countries. To this must be added, as agreed in Rio + 20, the right of each country to freely decide its own forms and ways of sustainable development.</li>
<li>It is the peoples, represented by their governments, who have the duty and responsibility to mediate and balance the interests of the different actors that live within their countries. It is neither possible nor acceptable to delegate State responsibilities in the private sector. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is and must be a Convention guided by the countries, not a round of business focused on questioned market mechanisms or a space for the enrichment of private enterprise. Each country must decide internally, according to their needs, priorities and development model, as efforts would be articulated with the non-governmental or subnational sectors, trying to impose a uniform scheme for all nations is contrary to the respect of national sovereignties.</li>
<li>There is no solution without justice and there can only be justice if the mistakes and abuses of the past are corrected now, in this present that we have lived and that will leave its mark in the future. Any agreement behind the back of justice and the past is a scam to the peoples of the world who have their eyes on us. We must look with optimism, commitment and dignity on the future, with our feet firmly planted in the present, with a clear awareness of justice and history.</li>
<li>Climate Change is one of the facets of the global environmental crisis generated by excessive and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, particularly in developed countries. Therefore, only the modification of these patterns constitutes a true and lasting solution to the environmental crisis and therefore to Climate Change.</li>
<li>Venezuela, being a country with low altitude areas, insular areas, low coastal areas, arid and semi-arid zones, areas exposed to floods, drought and desertification, and areas with fragile mountain ecosystems; besides being a developing country whose economy depends in particular on the production, use and exportation of fossil fuels, all categories established in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as highly vulnerable; it is a country particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of climate change and the secondary effects of potential response measures. This vulnerability has been evident in a series of emergencies and natural disasters with severe effects on housing, food production, electricity generation and biological diversity, among others.</li>
<li>Although Venezuela is not a country with historical responsibilities in Climate Change, it has undertaken an ambitious series of nationally financed actions with a high incidence in the repair of losses and damages, adaptation and mitigation. Within the framework of what was agreed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in relation to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), Venezuela, committed to the construction of an eco-socialist productive economic model, presents here some of its contributions in this matter. These actions are articulated within the framework of the Nation's Economic and Social Development Plan, which considers the deepening of ecosocialist policies with a high social, economic and environmental impact in terms of Climate Change. Venezuela presents ambitious contributions in adaptation and mitigation, encompassing actions and policies towards a just and sustainable development. These contributions have been advanced voluntarily and with their own financing. They had not been presented formally, until now, in the framework of the fight against Climate Change. The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change in the framework of an integral, humanistic and ecosocialist development oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth. in the framework of the fight against Climate Change. The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change in the framework of an integral, humanistic and ecosocialist development oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth. in the framework of the fight against Climate Change. The Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation establishes the priority of the fight against Climate Change in the framework of an integral, humanistic and ecosocialist development oriented to Good Living in harmony with Mother Earth.</li>
<li>The emissions of Venezuela (0.24 Gton CO <sub>2</sub>eq / year) only represent 0.49% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. However, as part of the policies established in the country's economic and social development plan, Venezuela intends to implement a National Mitigation Plan in conjunction with a National Adaptation Plan. The National Mitigation Plan will aim to reduce the country's emissions by at least 20% by 2030 in relation to the inertial scenario, understood as a hypothetical scenario in which the plan is not implemented. The extent to which this goal is achieved will depend on the fulfillment of the commitments of developed countries in terms of provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity building in accordance with Article 4.7 of the Convention.</li>

<p><em>Sources of base information: </em><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/"><em>http://www.worldbank.org/</em></a><em> (Emissions of carbon dioxide derived from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement, including carbon dioxide produced by the consumption of solid fuels, liquids, combustible gases and gas burning).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It is clear, however, that the actions and policies of a single country are not enough. Only if countries with historical responsibilities fully assume such responsibilities through ambitious mitigation goals (between 50 and 70% reduction of current emissions according to the IPCC in its 5th report, which estimate is likely to increase as knowledge is improved) and the reliable, sufficient and predictable provision of means of implementation (financing, technology transfer and capacity building) to developing countries; we can aspire to a real, just and lasting solution to the problem of Climate Change. This goes through the establishment of global goals for all means of implementation, and monitoring systems, report and verification for compliance by the developed countries. The means of financing must come from public funds and be administered under the Convention according to the priorities and needs established nationally by each country. The technology transfer must be oriented to the "development and improvement of endogenous capacities and technologies of the Parties that are developing countries" (Article 4.5, UNFCCC) considering mechanisms for the flexibilization of intellectual property rights that make this possible. The new agreement signed in Paris must be an agreement based on justice and aimed at deepening the implementation of the Convention under its principles and provisions; that establishes ways to settle the climate debt of developed countries,</li>
<li>According to the decisions of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela presents its Nationally Determined Contributions to the fight against Climate Change and its effects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>B.- Actions and programs with impact on adaptation or mitigation of Climate Change and its effects</h2>
<p>Venezuela has developed a series of programs within which it has undertaken important actions, contributing to the fight against Climate Change and its effects from a perspective of justice and social inclusion. These programs could be deepened and multiplied by the fulfillment of the commitments of provision of means of implementation by the developed countries under the Convention. Some are listed below:</p>
<h3>INDUSTRY</h3>
<h4>Oil industry</h4>
<ul>
<li>As compensatory measures associated with PDVSA projects and ordered by environmental legislation, the oil industry has carried out the establishment and maintenance of compensatory forests in a total area of 14,423 hectares. These agroforestry systems (compensatory, production and protection forests) function as carbon sinks. Validation of the field variables is currently carried out to perform the estimation of CO <sub>2</sub> fixation . The establishment of an additional 184 hectares of Agroforestry Systems is planned for the 2016-2019 period.</li>
<li>The industry is currently developing a significant number of projects to minimize or exploit the gas burned and / or vented by PDVSA in its exploration and production operations; this implies the adaptation of operations and facilities in terms of infrastructure and facilities for the use of natural gas. It is estimated that in a period of two years, an accumulated total of 516 KTon of CO <sub>2</sub> has stopped emitting into the atmosphere, due to the use of natural gas. For the 2016-2019 period, future projects are expected to be completed, and estimated that thanks to the execution of these projects the amount of 538.2 KTon CO <sub>2</sub> eq / year will be emitted to the atmosphere .</li>
</ul>
<h4>Basic and Intermediate Industries</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan 200 Socialist factories</strong>: Creation and repowering of recycling companies; Pulpaca (company with recycling capacity of wood and paper for the manufacture of paper coils), INVEPAL recycling line, VENEVIDRIO (Use up to 90% of glass for recycling in its production process), Sideror complex and SIDOR use up to a 100% scrap in its production process, installation project of production lines in the companies of the plastic corporation, strategic alliances with the private sector for the supply of secondary raw material for the industry and proposal of law of Management and Recovery of Residues as Secondary Raw Material for its Incorporation in the National Industry. All these initiatives generate an increase in energy efficiency and a decrease in the need to extract raw materials,</li>
<li><strong>National project for the progressive</strong> elimination of substances that deplete the ozone <strong>layer:</strong> The progressive elimination of the use of substances that deplete the ozone layer and affect climate change, in compliance with the Montreal Protocol, seeks to reduce consumption in the country by 10% for the year 2015 with respect to its baseline of consumption country established in 207 tons of ozone-depleting potential, associated with the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), mainly in refrigeration, air conditioning and polyurethane foams. Through the plan of training and awareness of the actors involved on the environmental hazard represented by the misuse of halogenated refrigerants, as well as the adequacy of the legal standard This has meant the reduction of 2.5 MTon CO <sub>2</sub>eq.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ELECTRIC POWER</h3>
<h4>Energy efficiency, rational use of energy and complementary energies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 70% of the energy in Venezuela is hydroelectric, which implies that the country is exceptionally clean in its energy matrix but at the same time highly vulnerable to droughts.</li>
<li>Energy efficiency, the rational use of energy and the promotion of complementary energies have been strengthened as a policy with the creation of the Office of Deputy Minister of New Sources and Rational Use of Electric Power.</li>
<li>With the aim of reducing this national vulnerability in terms of electricity generation in the face of drought, thermoelectric plants have been built, generating a 4.38% reduction in the dependence on energy production through large hydroelectric power plants, with respect to the energy matrix of 2010. On the other hand, the substitution of thermoelectric generation technology based on liquid fuels (diesel and fuel-oil) by natural gas and combined cycle technologies in the country's generating plants was initiated, with an increase 6.92% in generation with gas turbines with respect to the national energy matrix of 2010.</li>
<li>Through the <em>Replacement Program of Incandescent</em> Bulbs by Saving Light Bulbs, from 2006 until the first half of 2015, 206,000,000 (206 million) of Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) have been installed.</li>
<li>Other measures include:
<ul>
<li>Replacement program for air conditioning equipment (A / C) and efficient equipment refrigerators. 42,504 A / A (between 2011-2013) and 3,077 refrigerators were replaced during 2012.</li>
<li>Construction of two wind farms with high capacity (Paraguaná and La Guajira).</li>
<li>Implementation of the <em>Sembrando Luz</em> Program that allows to provide electrical service to isolated communities, through hybrid systems of wind and solar energy. The management of the associated facilities has involved 1,327 training actions with 14,617 beneficiaries.</li>
<li>Promulgation of legal regulations on Energy Efficiency: Law of rational and efficient use of energy; Resolutions on Energy Efficiency for the Public and Private Sector; Technical Regulations on energy efficiency parameters in electrical appliances: A / C, Refrigerators, LFC; Gradual prohibition of importation of incandescent bulbs. Labeling standards for energy efficiency; electric tariffs staggered according to consumption, prohibition of import of inefficient devices.</li>
<li>Implementation of <em>the Green Band Plan</em> aimed at the residential sector.</li>
<p>Through this plan, households that stay within the energy consumption bands established for each region of the country receive a subsidy in the electricity tariff.</p>
<li>Ministerial resolutions is for reduction of electricity consumption in the public and private sector. A reduction of 12% in electric power consumption for the public sector and 8% for the private sector has been obtained to date.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Energy Education and Communication Campaign</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conformation of 3,000 Integral Community Educational Brigades nationwide, meetings of knowledge and experiences, state and national municipal.</li>
<li>Inclusion of content on the Rational and Efficient Use of Electric Energy (UREE) in the Bicentennial Book Collection and computers of the massive computer program for elementary and high school students "Canaimitas".</li>
<li>Training actions directed to the Popular Power: Organizations, Communes, Communal Councils, Institutions.</li>
<li>Realization of twelve Diploma in energy efficiency aimed at public and private sector workers nationwide.</li>
<li>Inclusion of content on the rational use of energy, energy efficiency and renewable energies, in undergraduate studies, specializations, studies not conducive to degree and others.</li>
<li>Inclusion of contents related to energy and its impact on the environment within school curricula.</li>
<li>State and national school meetings with children of primary education on the rational and efficient use of energy.</li>
<li>Massive energy-saving communication campaigns: "Saving energy is everyone's task", "I am Conscious, Efficient Consumption".</li>
</ul>
<h3>LIVING PLACE</h3>
<h4>Great Housing Mission Venezuela</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Great Housing Mission emerged in 2010 as a response to the emergency generated by torrential rains that affected hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of the poorest areas of the country. Through this Mission, more than 800 thousand homes have been built and delivered until November 2015 and the construction of three million homes is planned as an accumulated goal for 2019. This mission means a response to losses and damages caused by extreme rains near 150 thousand people affected and a reduction of vulnerability to the effects of Climate Change for more than 12 million people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TRANSPORT</h3>
<h4>Mission Transportation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Under the motto of "Collective Mobility for Good Living", the Ministry of People's Power for Land Transport and Public Works develops the Transportation Mission, created on March 27, 2014. The Transportation Mission is structured in vertices of action: National Registry , Territorial Coverage, Services, Financing, Education, Infrastructure and Urban Mobility. Its implementation implies the most efficient use of means of transport and the improvement and updating of the vehicle fleet resulting in greater efficiency and lower emissions. It includes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Massification of Spare Parts and Supplies.</li>
<li>Security of Users and Transporters in the Framework of the Mission to All Life Venezuela.</li>
<li>Financing through Public Banking for Fleet Renewal.</li>
<li>Shelters for Gandolas and Extraurban Buses.</li>
<li>Motorized Shelters.</li>
<li>Driver school.</li>
<li>Construction and conditioning of Passenger Terminals.</li>
<li>Asphalted in the layout of urban transport routes.</li>
<li>Construction of road solutions in cities.</li>
<li>Constitution of New Transport Systems.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Main Achievements of the Mission Transportation</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>National Census of Transporters: It</em> allows to update the registry of Transporters: labor condition, situation of fleet, routes, stops and state of the units. It also involves the registration of unmet transportation needs of all communities. To date, 96,500 Carriers have been registered and 3000 communities have been registered. The installation of the <em>Technical Mobility Tables</em>is contemplated : which will bring together all the living forces of each state in order to study the traffic problems and propose their possible solutions. This diagnosis will also allow establishing a mobility map in each city.</li>
<li>A road construction, reconstruction and maintenance plan has been developed throughout the national territory, so 51 road solutions will have been enabled before the end of 2015. These solutions allow traffic decongestion and considerable time reductions in time of vehicular mobilization, managing to reduce the environmental impact of the vehicle fleet in the country.</li>
<li>New BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) systems have been created in the cities of Maracay, Barquisimeto, Barcelona, Maracaibo, Puerto La Cruz, Mérida and Caracas. These special transportation systems have exclusive channels, intelligent stops and security systems with satellite location.</li>
<li>45 new surface public transport systems have been created with state-of-the-art units that cover 329 new operational routes serving more than 3 million people in 120 cities in the country.</li>
<li>Inauguration of the Yutong Bus Plant, part of the China-Venezuela agreement, with an assembly capacity of 14 modern units per day.</li>
<li>Creation of the Carrier Bank and delivery of state credits for the transport sector through public banking, which has allowed the renewal of the fleet by delivering 715 Units to 405 beneficiary lines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Construction and expansion of Mass Transportation Systems with the consequent decrease in the use of vehicles.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Currently, CA Metro de Caracas executes a set of Line expansion projects, such as Line 5 (12.5 Km and 10 stations) and the Caracas-Guarenas-Guatire System (30 Km and 7 stations). ). In addition, the renovation and reconditioning of Line 1 is carried out. These works are complemented by two projects, which constitute auxiliary transportation solutions to the Metro system, such as the Mariche cableway subway and the Bolivarian cable train.</li>
<li>Currently, Line II of the Los Teques Metro System is under construction, which will go from the First Alí Station, located in the El Tambor sector, to San Antonio de los Altos, will have a length of 12 kilometers and will be distributed by six (06) stations. , which will tour the Guaicaipuro, Carrizal and Los Salias municipalities.</li>
<li>Line 2 of the Valencia Metro System is under construction in the state capital of Carabobo, which will have an area of 4.3 km and will benefit approximately more than 1,800,000 people.</li>
<li>The Puerto Cabello - La Encrucijada Railway, which has a length of 108.8 kilometers, is under construction and is focused on the development of the North - Coastal axis of the country, through an intermodal, modern, fast and economic transport system able to mobilize more than 14 million users per year and transport more than 11 million tons of cargo per year. It will have six stations: Puerto Cabello, Naguanagua, Guacara, San Joaquín, Mariara and Maracay. In addition to San Diego and La Encrucijada that will be used for the placement of livestock, agricultural, livestock and industrial merchandise, and its subsequent distribution throughout the national territory. Thanks to this railway branch will significantly reduce the movement of cargo transport. This work will generate 5 thousand 422 jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>HEALTH</h3>
<h4>Increase in health care coverage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before the Bolivarian Revolution in 1999, more than 60% of people living in popular sectors had never gone to a doctor for a general check-up visit. In 2015, 12 years have passed since the creation of Barrio Adentro, an unprecedented mission that allows access to high-tech health services free of charge to significant sectors of the population. Barrio Adentro is responsible for at least 704 million 958 thousand free medical consultations in the last 12 years.</li>
<li>Barrio Adentro was created in 2003 with the help of the government of Cuba, to offer health services to the Venezuelan population in small outpatient clinics built and equipped with medical supplies in previously unattended areas. Later, Barrio Adentro II was created to expand medical services, with the construction of larger outpatient clinics, and then in 2005 Barrio Adentro III, through which 600 Integral Diagnostic Centers and 600 Integral Rehabilitation Rooms were built. In 2006 Barrio Adentro IV began with the inauguration of specialized centers such as the Children's Cardiology Hospital in Caracas.</li>
<li>The creation of these health programs implies a reduction in vulnerability to diseases, including those whose incidence and geographical distribution will increase as a result of Climate Change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>POPULAR ORGANIZATION AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
<ul>
<li>The strengthening of social organization in Venezuela is crucial for reducing vulnerability to climate change. The 2013 Communal Census made it possible to quantify 40,035 Communal Councils, 1,401 Communes, 1,294 Social Battle Rooms and 28,791 Social Movements, totaling 71,521 social organizations throughout the country. Currently, 1,377 communes and 45,333 communal councils have been registered (Source: Ministry of People's Power for the Communes (2015), accessed on 11/2/2015, available at <a href="http://www.mpcomunas.gob.ve/)">http://www.mpcomunas.gob.ve/).</a> Communes and Communal Councils are forms of social organization that through territorialization processes generate actions to reduce vulnerability through self-construction, organization for sustainable production and organization for life in communities where transportation and consumption are reduced by the territorialization and accessible location of services and supplies for life: local schools, markets, health centers, among others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY</h3>
<h4>National Strategy for Biological Diversity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Since 2010, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has had the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010-2020 (ENCDB) and its National Action Plan (PAN), advancing five years to Goal 17 for 2015 of the Strategic Plan for Biological Diversity (Aichi) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The ENCDB and its PAN, as part of the First and Second Socialist Plan of Economic and Social Development of the Nation, dictates the fundamental guidelines that will allow, during this decade, the national articulation for the collective construction of an alternative life model based on the sustainability These instruments represent the methodological, conceptual and political framework aligned to the country project,</li>
<li>The ENCDB and its NAP were built with the simultaneous participation of organized communities, students, collectives, professors, officials and militants, organized in workshops in numerous workshops, which counted with the participation of more than 5,000 people nationwide. During these meetings, debates were generated that allowed the inclusion of the different worldviews present in our territory, promoting strategic planning from the local realities and taking advantage of the strengths of the different regions of the country.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Venezuelan Congress of Biological Diversity</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Venezuelan Congress of Biological Diversity has been a space for the meeting of knowledge and the exchange of experiences. For six consecutive years it has allowed the consolidation of anti-colonial and sovereign ways of circulation of knowledge, making possible the emergence of new actors and actors producing knowledge through dialogue. These congresses are characterized by the presence of different matrices of rationality, the complementarity of visions, the recognition of diversity and the exchange of experiences as premises.</li>
<li>In turn, this space functions as a mechanism for the socialization of knowledge about biological diversity from different perspectives and perspectives. The congress is part of the National Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity 2010-2020, with the aim of socializing knowledge and promoting inclusion and social justice. This congress contributes to the monitoring of the strategy itself and its plan and has been consolidated as a periodic (annual / biennial) space for the exchange of knowledge and experiences on the conservation of biological diversity with social commitment.</li>
<li>This periodic event is supported by a ministerial resolution, which seeks to ensure its continuity, also becoming a meeting place between institutions, groups, producers, producers, cultores of science, comuneros, militants, amateurs, fans and all different actors linked to the preservation of life and good living, including adaptation to Climate Change. To date, more than 12 thousand people have participated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FOOD SOVEREIGNTY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</h3>
<p>One of the sectors that are most strongly impacted by Climate Change is the food production sector. The promotion of agroecological systems based on sustainability and respect for natural ecosystem processes, urban and peri-urban agricultural systems and the prevention of climate risks, are very effective measures of adaptation to climate change. Some actions and programs in this sense are listed below:</p>
<h4>Network of biological input laboratories:</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are 28 laboratories for the production of biological inputs (biocontrollers and biofertilizers) at a national level to replace the use of agro-toxins. Biological input management protocols have been developed for seed production, as well as corn, legume and vegetable sowing plans. This network of laboratories is under the responsibility of the National Institute of Integral Agricultural Health (INSAI).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conservation of agrobiodiversity:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Six annual Congresses on Biological Diversity have been held, where topics related to cultural and biological diversity are discussed. The discussion to strengthen the organization of social movements around the assessment, conservation, reproduction and distribution of peasant, indigenous and Afro-descendant seeds is a relevant contribution for the agrobiodiversity sector. In this same order of ideas, a peasant, indigenous, intellectual and cultural movement has been strengthened with the articulating axis of protecting the biological and cultural diversity associated with seeds, as a defense against climate change, and developing organizational activities , dissemination of audiovisual material, training and production of food and seeds with high organizational balances,</li>
<li>Experiences have been carried out to rescue potatoes and other native Andean crops and incorporate these varieties into national plans and public policies on seeds.</li>
<li>In 2015, the Seed Law was enacted. This Law is oriented to preserve, protect and guarantee the production, multiplication, conservation, free circulation and the use of the seed; as well as the promotion, research, innovation, distribution and exchange of the same, from a socialist agroecological vision; privileging the national production of seeds and placing special emphasis on the valuation of indigenous, Afro-descendant, peasant and local seeds.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Agroecology</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program all hands to sowing</strong> : It was created by resolution of the Ministry of Popular Power for Education (Resolution No. 024, dated April 15, 2009). The National program establishes the incorporation of the contents referring to agroecology in the curricular development, within the integrator axis Environment and Integral Health, where agroecology must be part of the learning processes in the Venezuelan Educational System, from initial education to the secondary</li>
<li>Creation of training programs for Bachelor and Diploma in Agroecology (Bolivarian University of Venezuela and Institute of Advanced Studies).</li>
<li>Creation of the Paulo Freire Latin American University Institute of Agroecology (IALA).</li>
<li>Program of urban and peri-urban gardens.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Program of urban and peri-urban agriculture "Agrocity"</h4>
<ul>
<li>In 2009, this program was created at the national level to promote and consolidate urban and peri-urban agriculture, as a system of family and community organization and integration that guarantees sustainability in terms of improving the availability of food. It was under the responsibility of the CIARA foundation and now FONDAS (National Fund for Agrarian Socialist Development of the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Lands). In the case of the Capital District, this year the secretariat of Caracas Productiva was created in the Government of the Capital District, called to promote productive experiences in the city with an agroecological approach. This secretariat articulates 550 productive experiences in the city, reducing vulnerability to Climate Change in the area of agriculture and food production.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reduction of climate risks in agricultural activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of Sowing Calendars by the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (INAMEH), to minimize the risks in agricultural production and the adequate management of water and inputs in general, as key factors in the achievement of full food sovereignty. Among other things, it involves performing Agrometeorological Zoning. Some expected benefits are:</li>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of the impacts of summer and meteorological droughts.</li>
<li>Choice of pastures resistant to droughts and flood zones.</li>

<h3>WATER CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 1999 the Bolivarian Government initiated, through the Technical Water Tables, a process of incorporation of the People's Power into water management, constituting these in public and permanent spaces where the organized people exercise the right to protagonist participation and co-responsibility related to the drinking water service and environmental sanitation. These community organizations allow the empowerment of Popular Power for diagnosis, attention to their needs, formulation and accompaniment in the execution of community projects with the direct management of financial resources, promoting in turn the creation of a culture and environmental values for the conservation and efficient use of water.</li>
<li>In 2015, the Community Water Management Rooms were created, which allow the articulation of all the entities involved in water management, including the technical water tables and other forms of popular organization and increasing the efficiency in the management of distribution networks. of drinking water and collection of wastewater from its territory.</li>
<li>Currently there are 7454 technical water tables throughout the national territory. This organization is part of the achievements that have allowed more than 96% of the Venezuelan population to have access to potable water service and be a leading participant in the management of the service, increasing efficiency and reducing vulnerability to the effects of climate change. the availability and quality of water.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF FORESTS</h3>
<p>The conservation and sustainable management of forests is a measure of great incidence both in adaptation, reducing the vulnerability of forests, and in mitigation, due to the protection of sinks and the increase in the capture of CO <sub>2</sub> by them.</p>
<h4>Generation of legal instruments for the preservation of forest heritage and the sustainable use of forests:</h4>
<p><strong>Resolution 86 of 10/27/2008</strong></p>
<p>Calculation of wood volume extracted from the forest by a new formula (Smalian), which sincere 95% of the real volume; This has reduced the impacts of exploitation and allows the modernization of sawmilling and industrialization processes.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution 30 of 06/10/2009</strong></p>
<p>Regulates the use of forest species, considering the minimum diameters of cortabilidad, guarantees the processes of ecological succession, structure of the forest and biodiversity. It implies the adoption of sustainable forest management practices such as the mapping of usable trees for the optimization of the layout of the extraction routes.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution 29 of 06/10/2009</strong></p>
<p>Selection and Registration of Seed Trees, preserving germplasm banks and as seed sources, in order to guarantee the mega diversity of the Tropical Forest. Use of reduced impact techniques for forest exploitation, reducing by 70% the impact on the Forest in relation to the Extraction Techniques traditionally applied.</p>
<h4>National Socialist Forestry Company (ENAFOR)</h4>
<p>In 2010, ENAFOR was created, with an approach to sustainable forest management, based on a new paradigm for forest management, which considers low-impact techniques and the planning of forestry activities, in which the environmental and social on the economic aspects; It promotes projects of integral forest management, under the principle of multiple use, promoting the direct participation of local communities and other social organizations in the production, processing and distribution of goods and services derived from the forest. This company has implemented in the <strong>Imataca Forest Reserve (RFI) the Sustainable Forest Management Plan of the Imataca V Management Unit</strong> , whose results are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the new model of forest production in an area of one hundred sixty-six thousand three hundred and fifty hectares (166,350 ha), with the possibility of expanding to one million hectares (1,000,000ha).</li>
<li>According to the estimates made by ENAFOR, for an area of 200,000 ha of forests intervened and not intervened in the RFI (Units III and V), the carbon stored in them is equivalent to 159 ton / ha, which results in that area a total of 31,800,000 tons of C (116,388,000 tCO <sub>2</sub> eq), as the baseline. With the application of the new Forest Management Model applying the Technical and Legal Standards, it was estimated as direct avoided emissions: 1,136,759.35 tCO <sub>2</sub> eq for the 5 years of the project in 000 ha (227,351 tCO <sub>2</sub> eq for 5,000 ha / year ) indirect avoided emissions: 18,188,149 tCO <sub>2</sub> eq for the 5 years of the project (3,637,629CO <sub>2)</sub>eq per year at 80,000ha). As a baseline, a loss of 453,135 ton / year CO <sub>2</sub> eq is estimated due to the use of conventional forestry techniques for an area of 5,000 ha / year.</li>
<li>ENAFOR, has produced two hundred thousand (200,000) plants of which 60% one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) have been donated for planting by the Tree and Housing missions, this amounts to a surface close to one hundred hectares (100 ha). The remaining eighty thousand hectares (80,000ha) have been planted by ENAFOR for an equivalent surface of fifty hectares (50 ha). Communities have been incorporated into the different activities of Sustainable Forest Management, such as: agroforestry, tree measurements, piqueros, nurserymen, and social development.</li>
<li>Establishment of a Germplasm Bank for the preservation of forest species.</li>
</ul>
<h4>National Forest Inventory</h4>
<p>Project whose general objective is to provide homogeneous, detailed, reliable and continuous statistical and cartographic information on the state and evolution of forest resources. As well as the calculation of carbon potential and CO <sub>2</sub> eq of all types of forests nationwide. In this sense 133 plots have been inventoried representing an area of six million nine hundred ninety two thousand nine hundred fifty-three hectares (6,992,953 ha), equivalent to 7.62% of the entire national territory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project to monitor changes in coverage in the Amazon Region of Venezuela.</strong>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It consists in the systematic elaboration of: Deforestation Maps of the years 2000-2010-2013-2014, the National Plan of Monitoring of changes of coverage in real time and the Study of Base Line that allows to plan the reduction of the GHG sources.</p>
<h4>Prevention and Control of Forest Fires</h4>
<p>The country has developed a policy of safeguarding National Parks and Natural Monuments, mainly of the forest species found within these areas. More than 2,883 events within the protected areas administered by the National Parks Institute (INPARQUES) have been combated in a timely manner during the 2011-2015 period. The taking of effective actions allowed the protection of 98.47% of the forested areas located within the protected areas.</p>
<h4>Mission Tree</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Tree Mission is an ambitious national plan for reforestation promoted by the State since 2006, where communities (Community Councils, Conservation Committees, Schools, etc.) and public institutions participate. The reforestation is done for education, conservation, agroforestry and industrial purposes based on integral and sustainable management oriented to Good Living. Said reforestation contemplates the collection of seeds, production of plants in institutional, school or community nurseries, planting and maintenance for four continuous years. To date, more than 30 million plants have been established.</li>
