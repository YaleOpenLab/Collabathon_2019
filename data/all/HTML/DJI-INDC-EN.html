<p><strong>Republic of Djibouti</strong></p>
<h1 id="intended-nationally-determined-contribution-of-the-republic-of-djibouti">Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Republic of Djibouti</h1>
<p><strong>August 2015</strong></p>
<h2 id="executive-summary"><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></h2>
<p>The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the Republic of Djibouti is an extension of the country’s commitments to fighting the effects of climate change. The process of drafting the INDC enabled a summary of all of the policies and programmes linked to climate change. It also provided an opportunity to reassess financing needs to fund the country’s adaptation.</p>
<p>As an LDC and a coastal country of the Horn of Africa, the country’s vulnerability is considerably high.</p>
<p>As a result, this contribution reflects both the country’s political will to participate in the worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the scope of its adaptation needs.</p>
<p>The Republic of Djibouti has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 40% by the year 2030, representing close to 2 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>e, compared to projections for that year according to the businessas-usual scenario. This commitment is an ambitious one for a country like the Republic of Djibouti. It can be attained through a combination of mitigation measures and the development of sustainable economic sectors like renewable energies.</p>
<p>To fulfil that level of ambition, the Republic of Djibouti will need to invest more than US $3.8 billion, in collaboration with the international community. An additional US $1.6 billion, conditional on new funding sources like the Green Climate Fund, along with international support, would enable the country to reduce its emissions by a further 20% by 2030. The total effort, under both the unconditional and conditional scenarios, would essentially entail maintaining the country’s emissions at roughly their level in 2010.</p>
<p>In terms of adaptation, the Republic of Djibouti has undertaken numerous plans and programmes. The priority objectives are also linked to the country’s social priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of vulnerability to drought;</li>
<li>Protection against rising sea levels;</li>
<li>Improvement of access to water;</li>
<li>Protection of biodiversity;</li>
<li>Reinforcement of the resilience of rural populations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adaptation projects currently being implemented account for a budget of nearly €100 million. However, that sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation under the 2°C Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario.</p>
<p>These figures show that investing in adaptation measures is a crucial issue for the Republic of Djibouti. The country will not be able to raise the necessary funds on its own. With this contribution, the Republic of Djibouti wants to reaffirm its belief in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and to call on the international community to mobilise in response to this decisive issue for all of humanity.</p>
<h2 id="national-context">NATIONAL CONTEXT</h2>
<p>The Republic of Djibouti is located in the Horn of Africa, at the intersection of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The country has a semi-desert tropical climate characterised by recurring natural catastrophes and extended periods of drought. Its arable land, natural and mineral resources, and water resources are very low and are subject to strong pressure from climate change. With an estimated per capita gross national product (GNP) of US $1,030 in 2014, the Republic of Djibouti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and one of the most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>At COP19 in Warsaw, the Republic of Djibouti underscored the fact that climate change is a threat to the country’s food security and water resources, as well as to sustainable development. With its arid climate and low level of social development, the Republic of Djibouti is vulnerable to various climate-related effects, including extreme drought, extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, flash floods and the salinization of soils and water. These phenomena have already been observed in the country and are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future, according to the various climate scenarios.</p>
<p>In the case of an optimistic climate scenario, the cost of the damage is likely to exceed US $5 billion. Implementing adaptation measures would make it possible to anticipate the effects of climate change. An investment of close to US $1 billion would enable a reduction of the total costs of the impact by two, account taken of residual damage.</p>

<p>The Republic of Djibouti has thus adopted a proactive position to handling climate change. It ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of that convention, the country developed a second national communication, which it submitted to the UNFCCC in 2014. Earlier, in 2006, the country had already identified a number of priority adaptation and resilience actions as part of a National Adaptation Programme of Action encompassing activities in the agricultural, forestry, water, livestock and coastal sectors.</p>
<p>To combine the country’s fight against the effects of climate change with its economic development, the Republic of Djibouti is pursuing the objective of becoming a veritable economic crossroads and a showcase for sustainable development along the Red Sea. To achieve that aim, several political plans are under development, including national strategies for a green economy, for biodiversity and on climate change.</p>
<p>The Republic of Djibouti will work to contribute to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. This ambition will rely on the development of renewable energies such as geothermal, wind and solar power. But the country will need to focus its efforts on adaptation above all and seek out the support of the international community. The present contribution is part of a dynamic process and may be reassessed in line with changes in the national and international contexts.</p>

<p><h4 id="general-objectives">General objectives</h4></p>
<p>By means of unconditional measures, the Republic of Djibouti is committed to preventing 1.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e of future GHG emissions, thus reducing its emissions by 40% compared to the business-as-usual scenario.</p>
<p>The implementation of conditional measures would enable a further reduction in CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions by 0.9 Mt, or 20% of GHG emissions compared to the business-as-usual scenario for 2030. In this way, the conditional mitigation scenario would enable the Republic of Djibouti to maintain its volume of emissions at a level equivalent to that of 2010.</p>
<p><h4 id="business-as-usual-scenario">Business-as-usual scenario</h4></p>
<p>The linear sectoral projection was used to estimate the GHG emissions level in 2030 without the implementation of any mitigation measures. In that case, 2030 GHG emissions would more than double their level in 2010. Nearly 55% of those emissions come from the “Energy” category, making it a priority sector for the implementation of mitigation options by the Republic of Djibouti.</p>

<p>The Republic of Djibouti is preparing to launch its green economy strategy, the aims of which are to encourage the use of low carbon technologies that are resilient to climate change, to promote green jobs, and to take advantage of climate finance to raise funds nationally and internationally. This strategy will be developed for the economy’s key sectors, in line with the long-term vision for the country.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Republic of Djibouti is in the process of developing a national strategy on climate change. That strategy will draw on both the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), adopted in 2006. It will incorporate changes in regulations relating to buildings, air conditioners and refrigerators.</p>
<p>These two complementary strategies should enable the Republic of Djibouti to attain its 2030 targets as set out herein.</p>

<h3 id="equity-and-ambition-of-the-contribution-of-the-republic-of-djibouti">Equity and ambition of the contribution of the Republic of Djibouti</h3>
<p>On a global scale, the IPCC calculated the quantity of GHGs as more than 49,000 Mt of CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2004. As a result, the annual emissions produced by the Republic of Djibouti, estimated at close to 2 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2010, represent less than 0.005% of the global volume. In other words, its emissions are nonsignificant compared with worldwide emissions. Nonetheless, the Republic of Djibouti has prepared this contribution to reaffirm its belief in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and to take unprecedented measures in response to this issue.</p>
<p>As an LDC, it is vital for the Republic of Djibouti to reduce its emissions without significantly affecting the country’s economic and social development. This contribution guarantees an equitable commitment. In the case of the unconditional scenario, the level of GHG per GDP point will decrease from 2.5 in 2000 to 0.8 in 2030. In addition, the planned mitigation measures will support priority economic sectors like renewable energies and energy efficiency. On its own scale, the Republic of Djibouti is making significant contributions to reducing global emissions.</p>
<p>The planned unconditional level of emissions reductions, planned under the unconditional scenario, is 40% compared to the business-as-usual scenario for 2030. This ambitious commitment will support other country’s commitments so as to make a collective contribution to the global objective of limiting the global temperature rise to 2°C. For the Republic of Djibouti, upholding this objective will be essential, given the country’s heavy exposure to the impact of climate change. Adaptation and increased resilience will remain the priority for the country.</p>
<h2 id="djiboutis-contribution-to-adaptation">DJIBOUTI’S CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTATION</h2>
<h3 id="objectives-national-priorities-and-long-term-vision">Objectives, national priorities and long-term vision</h3>
<p>In recent years, climate change has already appeared in the form of increases in average global temperature and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like drought and flooding of oueds. For example, the minimum temperature recorded in Djibouti City has risen by close to 1.3°C in the space of 30 years. In addition, the geographical location of the Republic of Djibouti makes it directly vulnerable to the rising sea level, especially given that 88% of its population lives along the coastline.</p>
<p>These difficult conditions cause serious problems in terms of the availability of a sufficient quantity and quality of water resources, be it for the country’s human population, livestock or agriculture. The aquifer’s resources are no longer enough to meet the country’s multiple needs.</p>
<p>The Republic of Djibouti also boasts relatively significant land-based biodiversity (mangroves, Day Forest and endemic species). However, it is stricken by the ongoing shrinkage of its arable land and its biodiversity due to rapid desertification, which will only be exacerbated with rising temperatures. Likewise, in respect of marine ecosystems, more than half the coral cover is likely to disappear in the years to come.</p>
<p>This deterioration could have a profound effect on the local populations that are dependent on those resources and who already live in poverty. The various impacts of climate change engender major financial and human losses, primarily in the nation’s capital but also in the rest of the country. As a result, national adaptation priorities have been defined for 2035, broken down into multiple strategies. Concerning adaptation, this will entail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing vulnerability to drought;</li>
<li>Protecting against rising sea levels;</li>
<li>Improving access to water;</li>
<li>Protecting biodiversity;</li>
<li>Reinforcing the resilience of rural populations.</li>

<h2 id="implementation-methods">IMPLEMENTATION METHODS</h2>
<p><h4 id="capacity-building"><em>Capacity-building</em></h4></p>
<p>Given the weakness of its economic and financial capacities and the scale of its funding needs for poverty reduction, environmental management and sustainable development, Djibouti is one of the potential beneficiaries of this initiative. To be able to seize that opportunity, the country set itself the objective of developing a National Strategy for a Green Economy, which will enable it to better incorporate climate finance into its development, as well as a national strategy for preserving biodiversity and another on climate change in order to boost its resilience in respect of the harmful effects of climate change, whilst contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><h4 id="need-for-technology-transfers"><em>Need for technology transfers</em></h4></p>
<p>The majority of the options presented above, such as the construction of a geothermal, wind or photovoltaic power plant, will necessitate major technological transfers. It is therefore crucial for the Republic of Djibouti to establish long-term partnerships with university centres or private companies capable of supplying those technologies. At present, an important partnership with the German Cooperation is providing Djibouti with technical and financial support for the promotion of renewable energies.</p>
<p><h4 id="funding-needs"><em>Funding needs</em></h4></p>
<p>In a 6% growth scenario, the investment required to maintain an emissions level similar to that of 2010 (conditional scenario) is more than US $5.5 billion. The unconditional scenario, which is already financed, either by means of the national budget or through the support of the international community, represents approximately 70% of that amount.</p>
<p>For the measures forming the conditional scenario, whose cost is estimated at US $1.65 billion, it has yet to be determined the proportion of that investment that could be covered domestically. The national strategy for energy procurement and management, currently under development, should provide better visibility on this point. Nonetheless, considering the level of investment required, it is very likely that Djibouti will need to access international funding to cover a large proportion of that investment.</p>
<p>The adaptation projects currently being implemented account for a budget of nearly €100 million. That sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation under the 2°C Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario.</p>
<p>These figures show that investing in adaptation measures is a crucial issue for the Republic of Djibouti. The country will not be able to raise the necessary funds on its own. As a result, the mobilization of the international community will be vital.</p>
<p>Details of the implementation methods are provided in a dedicated document entitled “<em>Guide de mise en œuvre pour la Contribution Prévue Déterminée Nationale</em>” (“Implementation Guide for the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution”).</p>
