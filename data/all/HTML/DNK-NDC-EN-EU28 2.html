<h3><a id="Introduction_8"></a>Introduction</h3>
<ol>
<li>The EU and its 28 Member States are fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiating process with a view to adopting a global legally binding agreement applicable to all Parties at the Paris Conference in December 2015 in line with the below 2°C objective.</li>

<li>
<p>The Lima Conference confirmed the Warsaw decision that all Parties ready to do so should communicate their INDC in the first quarter of 2015 in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU and its Member States wish to communicate the following INDC. The EU and its Member States are committed to a <strong>binding target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990</strong>, to be fulfilled jointly, as set out in the conclusions by the European Council of October 2014. In line with the Lima Call for Climate Action, in particular its paragraph 14, the following <em>quantifiable information</em> is hereby submitted:</p>

Legislative proposals to implement the 2030 climate and energy framework, both in the emissions trading sector and in the non-traded sector, to be submitted by the European Commission to the Council and European Parliament in 2015-2016 on the basis of the general political directions by the European Council, taking into account environmental integrity.

 <td>The target represents a significant progression beyond its current undertaking of a 20% emission reduction commitment by 2020 compared to 1990 (which includes the use of offsets). It is in line with the EU objective, in the context of necessary reductions according to the IPCC by developed countries as a group, to reduce its emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990. Furthermore, it is consistent with the need for at least halving global emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. The EU and its Member States have already reduced their emissions by around 19% on 1990 levels while GDP has grown by more than 44% over the same period. As a result, average per capita emissions across the EU and its Member States have fallen from 12 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 1990 to 9 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 2012 and are projected to fall to around 6 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. in 2030. The emissions in the EU and its Member States peaked in 1979.

<li>
<p>The EU and its Member States urge all other Parties, in particular major economies, to communicate their INDCs by the end of March 2015 in a manner that facilitates their clarity, transparency and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU and its Member States request the UNFCCC Secretariat to publish the INDC of the EU and its Member States on its website and to take it into account when preparing the synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the INDCs communicated by Parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EU and its Member States look forward to discussing with other Parties the fairness and ambition of INDCs in the context of the below 2°C objective, their aggregate contribution to that objective and on ways to collectively increase ambition further.</p>
