<p>The present document (Oman INDC) has been prepared in coordination with various stakeholders in the country as per the mandate of Conference of the Parties (COP) and by its decision 1/CP.19, wherein all Parties have been invited to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. It takes into consideration the two aspects i.e. mitigation and adaptation. The information in the document are provided as per decision 1/CP.20</p>
<p><strong>The INDC of Oman</strong></p>
<p>Oman provides its INDC based on the following:</p>
<p>The implementation of the INDC is conditional to the assistance will be provided by the UNFCCC on finance, capacity building and transfer of technology</p>
