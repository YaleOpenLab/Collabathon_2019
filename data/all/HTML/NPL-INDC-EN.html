<p>Communicated to the UNFCCC Secretariat in February 2016</p>
<h3><a id="A_BACKGROUND_10"></a>A. BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Nepal, a least developed mountainous and land-locked country, is one of the least contributors to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). With aspirations of the people to improve the country’s economy; its development agenda is constrained given that it is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse impact of climate change.</p>
<p><h4><a id="1_Nepals_vulnerability_to_climate_change_14"></a>1. Nepal’s vulnerability to climate change</h4></p>
<p>Nepal’s mountainous and challenging topography and socio-economic conditions (ranks 145 on the Human Development Index, nearly one-fourth of its population live below poverty line) make it a highly vulnerable country to climate change.</p>
<p>Nepal has experienced changes in temperature and mean precipitation. The country, with the exception of some isolated pockets, has become warmer. Data on trends from 1975 to 2005 showed 0.06°C rise in temperature annually whereas mean rainfall has significantly decreased on an average of 3.7 mm (-3.2%) per month per decade. Under various climate change scenarios for Nepal, mean annual temperatures are projected to increase between 1.3-3.8°C by the 2060s and 1.8-5.8°C by the 2090s. Annual precipitation reduction is projected to be in a range of 10 to 20% across the country.</p>
<p>In Nepal’s Himalaya, total estimated ice reserve between 1977 and 2010 has decreased by 29 percent (129 km3). The number of glacier lakes increased by 11 percent and glaciers recede on an average by 38 km<sup>2</sup> per year during the same period. Hence, climate change has visible and pronounced impacts on snows and glaciers that are likely to increase the Glacier Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Nepal has suffered from the impacts of increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as landslides, floods and droughts resulting in the loss of human lives as well as high social and economic costs.</p>
<p>The 2013 study on Economic Impact Assessment of Climate Change in Key Sectors (agriculture, hydropower and water-induced disasters) has estimated direct cost of current climate variability and extreme events equivalent to 1.5 to 2% of current GDP/year (approximately USD 270-360 million/year in 2013 prices) and much higher in extreme years. In the case of hydropower, the model projected lower dry season flows and thus lower energy availability. The additional energy generation capacity needed to meet future demand under this scenario, due to climate change, was estimated at 2800 MW by 2050 with an increase in costs of USD 2.6 billion (present value) for the period through to 2050. Overall, the economic costs of climate change in Nepal for these three sectors could be equivalent to 2-3% of current GDP/year by mid-century.</p>
<p>Overall, Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, water-induced disasters and hydro-meteorological extreme events such as droughts, storms, floods, inundation, landslides, debris flow, soil erosion and avalanches. Based on National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) 2010, out of 75 districts, 29 districts are highly vulnerable to natural hazard such as landslides, 22 districts to drought, 12 districts to GLOFs, and 9 districts to flooding.</p>
<p>Nepal is ranked as the eleventh most earthquake-prone country in the world. It experienced a devastating earthquake of 7.6 magnitudes on 25 April 2015 with around 9,000 casualties and over 22,000 injuries. The destruction was widespread as it ruined houses, heritage sites, schools, health posts, and infrastructures (roads, bridges and hydro-electricity plants) and social systems (water supply, agricultural land, trekking routes, and sports facilities). Lives of about 8 million people have been severely impacted by this earthquake demanding unbelievably high cost of reconstruction.</p>
<p>Earthquake and climate-induced disasters have accelerated vulnerabilities and risks to water, sanitation and food security resulting in further aggravation of country’s vulnerabilities to climatic hazards.</p>
<p><h4><a id="2_Nepals_Emission_Scenario_30"></a>2. Nepal’s Emission Scenario</h4></p>
<p>Nepal’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is only around 0.027 percent of total global emissions. According to the Second National Communication (2015), GHG emissions from the energy sector is in increasing trend, and this is almost negligible in industry sector. With an agricultural economy, larger portion of GHGs emissions is from the agricultural sector, but the emissions due to increased use of fossil fuels have risen over time. For 1994, total GHGs emission from energy, industrial processes, agriculture and waste (without Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, LULUCF) was estimated at 29,347 CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Gg while it has declined to 24,541 CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Gg for 2000. However, total GHGs emission for 2008 has reached to 30,011 CO<sub>2</sub>-eq Gg, slightly increased from 1994 emission level. The country as a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) pursues and supports efforts to limit temperature rise to well below 2°C leading to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in order to reduce the risks and adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Nepal believes that the cumulative impacts of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted to the UNFCCC would greatly contribute to limiting temperature rise to safe levels and making this planet livable. Nepal has prepared its INDC in the process of implementing the decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COPs) through a broad-based stakeholder consultation processes.</p>
<h3><a id="B_NEPALS_ENHANCED_ACTIONS_TO_ADDRESS_CLIMATE_CHANGE_36"></a>B. NEPAL’S ENHANCED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
<p>Nepal has initiated several activities to reduce climate hazards and build resilience, help climate vulnerable communities cope with climate change impacts, and reduce impacts of climate change on its people, property and natural resources. Key and most relevant activities are briefly mentioned below:</p>
<p><h4><a id="1_Institutions_40"></a>1. Institutions</h4></p>
<p><h5><a id="a_Institutional_Strengthening_42"></a>a. Institutional Strengthening</h5></p>
<p>The Government of Nepal is strengthening its institutions to ensure implementation of climate change and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus (REDD+) programmes. The Climate Change Management Division in the Ministry of Population and Environment, and REDD Implementation Centre under the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation are dedicated to develop necessary prerequisites for the effective implementation of the UNFCCC provisions. The National Planning Commission and relevant ministries have also made necessary arrangement to integrate climate change concerns into their policies and programmes. Nepal has also established the Recovery and Reconstruction Authority to rebuild infrastructures and settlements devastated by the earthquake of April 2015 and make Nepal greener and more relisient to natural hazards. Several non-governmental and community-based organizations are also engaged in strengthening national and local entities to provide services to the climate vulnerable communities.</p>
<p><h5><a id="b_Coordination_Mechanism_46"></a>b. Coordination Mechanism</h5></p>
<p>Nepal has established coordination mechanisms at highest political level for necessary policy guidance and coordination and at local level for implementation on the ground. Establishment of Climate Change Council, Climate Change Coordination Committee and REDD Coordination and Monitoring Committee at the political levels and Multi-stakeholder Climate Change Initiatives Coordination Committee and REDD Working Group chaired by Secretaries of the concerned ministries provide guidance, ensure coordination and function to align climate change with development activities. The REDD Multi-Stakeholder Forum acts as an outreach and communication platform. The climate change networks managed by civil society organizations also contribute to generate and share knowledge on climate change and its impacts.</p>
<p><h4><a id="2_Policies_Strategies_and_Frameworks_50"></a>2. Policies, Strategies and Frameworks</h4></p>
<p><h5><a id="a_Climate_Change_Policy_52"></a>a. Climate Change Policy</h5></p>
<p>Nepal’s Climate Change Policy (2011) envisions a country spared from the adverse impacts of climate change, by considering climate justice, through the pursuit of environmental conservation, human development, and sustainable development - all contributing toward a prosperous society. The Policy has objectives of, inter alia, reducing GHG emissions by promoting the use of clean energy; enhancing the climate adaptation and resilience capacity of local communities for optimum utilization of natural resources and their efficient management; and adopting a low-carbon development path by pursuing climate- resilient socio-economic development.</p>
<p><h5><a id="b_Forestry_Sector_Policies_and_Strategies_56"></a>b. Forestry Sector Policies and Strategies</h5></p>
<p>Nepal emphasizes in mitigating adverse impacts of climate change, and in adopting adaptation measures. It strategizes to develop mitigation-friendly forest management systems. The working policies emphasizes, inter alia, to make community-based forests and watershed management climate adaptation-friendly, enhance carbon sequestration through sustainable management of forests, and support programmes that reduce carbon emissions from forest areas. More than 25,000 community-based forest management groups across the country are directly engaged in managing about 30% of the country’s total forest area. These community-based organizations are not only contributing to sequestering carbon dioxide by sustainable management of forest resources but also playing effective roles in designing and implementing Community Adaptation Plans of Action (CAPAs) based on forests and non-forests benefits.</p>
<p>Considering climate change mitigation and resilience as one of the major strategic pillars, the Forestry Sector Strategy (2016-2025) aims to enhance Nepal’s forest carbon stock by at least 5% by 2025 as compared to 2015 level, and to decrease mean annual deforestation rate by 0.05% from about 0.44% and 0.18% in the Terai and Siwalik hills respectively. It also aims to put in place forest carbon trade and payment mechanism and mainstream community/ecosystem-based adaptation by 2025.</p>
<p>Forest areas are planned to be managed in a variety of modalities and regimes including community forests, leasehold forests, collaborative forests and protected areas following a landscape approach to resource conservation and management. The benefits of forests are projected to use in forest-enterprise development, adaptation to climate change and contribution to local and national economy while sustainably conserving watershed and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014-2020) emphasizes biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience as keys to national prosperity. The Strategy recognizes legitimate rights of all Nepali people such as indigenous people and local communities, women, Dalits and other disadvantaged social groups over local biological resources.</p>
<p><h5><a id="c_Energy_Policy_66"></a>c. Energy Policy</h5></p>
<p>Nepal has a policy for maximum utilization of hydropower potential to meet its domestic demand of electricity by mitigating adverse environmental impacts. It also has a policy to accelerate renewable energy services, and increase access to the Renewable Energy technologies with subsidy provisions.</p>
<p>The National Rural Renewable Energy Programme (NRREP), under implementation, provides a framework for local communities across the country to have access to not only energy but also energy efficient technologies through various subsidy programmes.</p>
<p>By 2020, Nepal intends to expand its energy mix focusing on renewable by 20% and diversifying its energy consumption pattern to more industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p><h5><a id="d_EnvironmentFriendly_Vehicle_and_Transport_Policy_74"></a>d. Environment-Friendly Vehicle and Transport Policy</h5></p>
<p>This Environment-friendly Vehicle and Transport Policy (2014) aims, inter alia, to reduce emission from transport sector, increase the share of electric vehicle up to 20% by 2020, promote the transformation of other regular vehicle to electric vehicle, and provide subsidy scheme for the promotion of electric and non-motorized vehicles. It has a strategic approach to avoid unnecessary travel, reduce trip distance, promote the shift towards more sustainable transport modes such as non-motorized transport component in the transport plan, and further promote public transport systems. The Policy calls for an improvement in transport practices and technologies through diversifying towards electricity, hybrid and natural gases; promoting progressive and affordable standards for fuel quality, and regulating vehicle emissions in order to ensure compliance with air quality.</p>
<p><h5><a id="e_National_REDD_Strategy_78"></a>e. National REDD Strategy</h5></p>
<p>Nepal is finalizing the National REDD-plus Strategy and considers that REDD+ initiatives would further contribute to promoting sustainable management of forests, carbon sequestration and adaptation co-benefits. It has a vision to optimize carbon and non-carbon benefits of forest ecosystems for the prosperity of the Nepali people, and has objectives of, inter alia, reducing carbon emission, and enhancing carbon sequestration and climate resilience through both mitigation and adaptation approaches by minimizing the causes and effects of drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and intensifying sustainable management of forest resources.</p>
<p>Nepal will pilot a sub-national project on REDD+ to reduce about 14 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq by 2020 by addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation and strengthening governance mechanisms in all types of forests and protected areas.</p>
<p><h5><a id="f_Low_Carbon_Economic_Development_Strategy_84"></a>f. Low Carbon Economic Development Strategy</h5></p>
<p>As a roadmap to opt low carbon pathways, Nepal is in the process of finalizing its Low Carbon Economic Development Strategy (LCEDS) to further promote the use of renewable energy and look into the cross-sectoral approaches of the economy where GHGs emissions can be minimized. This pathway will aid Nepal to bolster social and economic developments and ensure environmental conservation while achieving the goals of sustainable development by reducing poverty.</p>
<p><h5><a id="g_National_Adaptation_Programme_of_Action_88"></a>g. National Adaptation Programme of Action</h5></p>
<p>As a least developed country Party to the UNFCCC and in accordance with the decisions of the seventh session of the COP held in Marrakesh, Nepal has prepared its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to Climate Change in September 2010 through extensive consultative processes to address the most urgent and immediate needs of adaptation. The effective implementation of NAPA priorities would provide multiple opportunities to help climate vulnerable communities and ecosystems to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change, and improve livelihoods by addressing most urgent and immediate adaptation needs.</p>
<p><h5><a id="h_National_Framework_on_Local_Adaptation_Plan_for_Action_92"></a>h. National Framework on Local Adaptation Plan for Action</h5></p>
<p>In order to localize climate change adaptation, Nepal has adopted a National Framework on Local Adaptation Plan for Action (LAPA) to ensure integration of adaptation and resilience into local to national planning processes. This ensures bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and flexible planning. The LAPA contributes to sensitizing local people and stakeholders, carrying out vulnerability and adaptation assessment; identifying, selecting and prioritizing adaptation options; and formulating and implementing adaptation plans. The framework provides opportunities to develop and implement a stand-alone LAPA and/or integrate adaptation options into the regular planning and implementation processes. At present, Nepal is implementing LAPAs in 90 Village Development Committees and 7 Municipalities - the lowest administrative units in the country. Similarly, about 375 local adaptation plans and nearly 2200 community adaptation plan of action (CAPAs) for community forests have been developed.</p>
<p><h5><a id="i_National_Adaptation_Plans_96"></a>i. National Adaptation Plans</h5></p>
<p>In 2015, Nepal launched a process to formulate and implement National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to address medium and long-term adaptation needs and reduce climate vulnerabilities. This will also promote integration of climate change adaptation into sectoral policies, strategies, plans and programmes. The NAP will be developed through country-driven, extensive consultation, participatory and transparent approaches and concerned ministry-led Thematic Working Groups.</p>
<p><h5><a id="j_Environment_Friendly_Local_Governance_Framework_100"></a>j. Environment Friendly Local Governance Framework</h5></p>
<p>Nepal is implementing an Environment-Friendly Local Governance (EFLG) Framework with the objectives of mainstreaming environment, climate change adaptation and disaster management in the local planning processes. The Framework also aims to make the local governance system environment-friendly and initiate sustainable development activities at the field level such as household and communities. Some of the indicators that the framework prioritizes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote renewable and clean energy and energy efficient technology</li>
<li>Increase greenery through tree plantation and management of gardens and parks.</li>
<li>Plant trees in at least 10% of the current open/barren land</li>
<li>Promote rainwater harvesting and ponds construction</li>
<li>Enhance waste management through environment friendly technology</li>
<li>Promote sustainable and organic farming and reduction of agro-chemicals</li>
<li>Increase disaster management skills at the local level</li>
<li>Control industrial pollution through effective regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the Local Governance and Community Development Programme has prioritized to implement rural renewable energy programmes, local climate change adaptive living facility and poverty-environment initiatives in selected districts, VDCs and municipalities to mitigate climate change impacts and help communities to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p><h5><a id="k_Channeling_Funding_For_Climate_Change_Activities_115"></a>k. Channeling Funding For Climate Change Activities</h5></p>
<p>The Government of Nepal is practicing a dedicated climate change budget code in its fiscal planning and budgeting processes to channel funding for climate change and related activities. The Climate Change Policy obliges to channel over 80% of the total climate finance to grassroots level activities.</p>
<p>In addition, the Agriculture Development Strategy (2015), National Conservation Strategy Framework (2015), Disaster Risk Reduction Management Strategy and periodical policies provide ample opportunities to help climate vulnerable to adapt and build resilience to climate change impacts.</p>
<p><h4><a id="3_Adaptation_Actions_121"></a>3. Adaptation Actions</h4></p>
<p>The Government of Nepal also realizes the importance of reducing climate change impacts and implements climate adaptation actions to protect life and improve livelihoods of the climate vulnerable communities and also improve ecosystem services. Nepal has also made significant progress in implementing adaptation actions as prioritized in its NAPA to help adapt and build resilience to climate change impacts. The LAPA Framework ensures the process of integrating climate change adaptation and resilience from local-to-national level planning processes that is bottom-up, inclusive, responsive and flexible.</p>
<p><h5><a id="a_Adapting_to_climate_change_125"></a>a. Adapting to climate change</h5></p>
<p>The Government of Nepal is implementing climate change adaptation and resilience programmes and projects with support from Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), multilateral agencies and bilateral support. At present, Nepal climate change support programme (NCCSP),Community-Based Flood Risk Reduction programme, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation Programme, including enhancing capacity, knowledge and technology support to build climate resilience of vulnerable communities, Hariyo Ban Project (climate adaptation component), and Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme (adaptation co-benefits) are under various stages of implementation. Localising climate adaptation actions has been deeply rooted in planning and implementation of NCCSP target areas. Additional efforts are underway to promote climate change adaptation into planning and programming processes.</p>
<p><h5><a id="b_Building_climate_resilience_129"></a>b. Building climate resilience</h5></p>
<p>The Government has accorded high priority to build climate resilience by integrating it into policies, strategies and programmes. At present, projects such as building climate resilient watersheds in mountainous eco-regions, building resilience to climate related hazards, mainstreaming climate change risk management in development, and building climate resilient communities through private sector participation are under various stages of implementation and are contributing to develop human resources so as to integrate climate change concerns in sectoral plans and programmes.</p>
<p>Nepal’s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) compromises four components i) Building Climate Resilience of Watersheds in Mountain Eco regions, ii) Building Resilience to Climate Related Hazards, iii) Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management, and iv) Building Climate Resilient Communities through Private Sector Participation. All the PPCR components are launched and are at different stage of implementation. The ongoing programs are complimenting each other and varied climate change programs in Nepal including those to implement LAPAs and other NAPA priorities.</p>
<p><h4><a id="4_Knowledge_Management_135"></a>4. Knowledge Management</h4></p>
<p>Nepal has initiated knowledge generation and dissemination by establishing a Climate Change Knowledge Management Centre. Several governmental, non-governmental and community-based organizations, academic and research institutions are involved in generating and disseminating data and information on climate change and its impacts in the recent years.</p>
<p><h4><a id="5_Mitigation_Actions_139"></a>5. Mitigation Actions</h4></p>
<p><h5><a id="a_Clean_energy_development_pathways_141"></a>a. Clean energy development pathways</h5></p>
<p>Nepal’s energy use is primarily dominated by traditional sources energy, mainly biomass for domestic purposes. Renewable energy contributes to only 1% of the total energy use. Currently, 56% of the population has regular access to electricity for lightning. Despite a huge potential for renewable energies such as hydropower, solar power and wind energy, these resources have not been sustainably captured due to geographical, technical, political and economical reasons. As a result the country is facing acute power shortage of electricity and load shedding may stretch up to 15 hours per day in winter season.</p>
<p>Regardless of these difficulties, Nepal has continued to prioritize the generation and utilization of clean energy, particularly through hydro-electricity at a larger scale. For the last two decades, micro-hydro, solar, biogas and improved cook stoves have been promoted at the rural scale and in line with the National Rural and Renewable Energy Programme in the recent years.</p>
<p>The Subsidy Delivery Mechanism for renewable energy has been promoted since 2006 to ensure disbursement of subsidy in a cost effective and easy access manner in rural areas. Recently, the Government of Nepal has launched an initiative to promote solar energy, renewable energy technologies and energy-efficient technology in urban areas.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent fuel crisis that sparked from September 2015 has accorded high priority to scale-up production of renewable energy technologies in order to meet the energy demands of urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Nepal is planning to generate clean energy as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>4,000 MW of hydroelectricity by 2020 and 12,000 MW by 2030;</li>
<li>2,100 MW of solar energy by 2030 with arrangements to distribute it through the grid;</li>
<li>Additional 220 MW of electricity from bio-energy by 2030;</li>
<li>Additional 50 MW of electricity from small and micro hydropower plants;</li>
<li>Increase the share of biogas up to 10% as energy for cooking in rural areas; and</li>
<li>Equip every households in rural areas with smokeless (improved) cooking stoves (ICS) by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p><h5><a id="b_Afforestation_and_Enhancing_Carbon_Sequestration_158"></a>b. Afforestation and Enhancing Carbon Sequestration</h5></p>
<p>The Government has a strategy to maintain at least 40% of the total area of the country under forests. It further promotes afforestation in public and private lands, environment-friendly infrastructure development and the conservation of biodiversity. It also promotes the management of ecosystems in different eco-regions of the country which will endorse sustainable management of forests, enhance capacity of local communities in adaptation and resilience, widen carbon storage through sustainable forest management and reduce carbon emissions. It also seeks to make the forest management plan climate adaptation-friendly, and implement REDD+ policies.</p>
<p>The Government has announced a forest decade for 2014-2023, with a theme: <strong>‘one house one tree’, ‘one village one forest’ and ‘one town several parks’</strong> that aims at creating new forests and tree groves in areas where forests have already been lost, in addition to managing natural forests. The forests and watersheds lying on the chain of Siwalik hills are also being managed on the basis of upstream-downstream linkages in which both the forest ecosystems in the Siwalik and the fertile cultivated land in the down south are taken into consideration as complementing to each other. Conservation and management of this area, including implementation of forests, soil and water conservation activities, is expected to greatly sequestrate carbon and could function as the carbon sink.</p>
<p><h5><a id="c_Moving_towards_Environmentally_Sustainable_Transport_System_164"></a>c. Moving towards Environmentally Sustainable Transport System</h5></p>
<p>Promotion of public transport system and bicycle use, introduction of fuel tax used in Kathmandu Valley for air quality improvement and further promotion of non-motorised transport would contribute to the reduction of pollution in urban areas.</p>
<p><h5><a id="d_Promoting_Climate_Friendly_Practices_in_Agriculture_168"></a>d. Promoting Climate Friendly Practices in Agriculture</h5></p>
<p>Nepal is implementing farmers’ schools where local varieties of crops will be promoted using local and indigenous knowledge and building on efficient technologies. Similarly, efforts are underway to develop flood and drought-resistant crop varieties to cope with climate change impacts. Nepal with its Agriculture Development Strategy will gradually move towards commercial agriculture considering climate change vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><h5><a id="e_Waste_management_and_air_pollution_Control_172"></a>e. Waste management and air pollution Control</h5></p>
<p>Nepal promotes the generation of energy from waste, by converting and managing waste and minimizing the release of methane.</p>
<p><h5><a id="f_Building_Codes_176"></a>f. Building Codes</h5></p>
<p>Nepal in its drive for reconstruction in the post-earthquake situation will strive to promote greener, smarter and better homes as guided by the National Reconstruction Authority. The building code has provisioned for at least two trees in home garden, and rainwater harvesting and solar light in urban homes.</p>
<h3><a id="C_NEPALs_INDC_180"></a>C. NEPAL’s INDC</h3>
<p>Nepal, a land-locked mountainous country, faces challenges of reducing poverty and addressing people’s basic needs. With the increasing adverse visible impacts of climate change and recent earthquake, Nepal is continuously facing additional burden from climate change and urgently requires huge investments in adapting and building resilience to climate change in order to protect its people, property and natural resources. It is, therefore, imperative for Nepal to tackle the impact of poverty and climate change simultaneously to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current energy mix of the country shows that most of Nepal’s energy is dependent on biomass followed by fossil fuels. The residential sector consumes most of the energy. Nepal has to diversify its energy mix and energy consumption patterns to more renewable and other economically productive sectors. However, given its current economic situation, Nepal will need technical and financial supports from development partners to provide relevant technologies, and build its capacity to be cleaner and greener while flourishing as one of the top tourism destinations in the world. In view of this, Nepal follows the low-carbon development pathway while promoting climate adaptation and resilience.</p>
<p>The Government of Nepal realizes the importance of reducing the impact of climate change and seeks to implement climate adaptation actions to protect life and life-support systems as well as improve the livelihoods of climate vulnerable communities. The cumulative impacts of NDCs would greatly contribute to limiting the rise in temperature to safe levels and make this planet livable. Hence, Nepal has prepared this INDC through a broad-based stakeholder consultation processes.</p>
