<p>Protocol Decision No 41, 10 September, 2015<br>
Government of the Republic of Armenia</p>
<h2><a id="Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contribution_of_the_Republic_of_Armenia_under_the_UN_Climate_Change_Framework_Convention_4"></a>Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of the Republic of Armenia under the UN Climate Change Framework Convention</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Republic of Armenia ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in May 1993 as a developing country not included in Annex I to the Convention. In December 2002, Armenia ratified the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The geographical location of the Republic of Armenia (landlocked mountainous country with vulnerable ecosystems), and the country’s need to ensure its national security, necessitates the prioritization of climate change adaptation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Republic of Armenia stated its position on the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in subsequent national communications to the UNFCCC and in the Republic of Armenia’s Statement on Association with Copenhagen Accords:</p>
<ul>
<li>In relation to low carbon development Armenia describes the term ‘fairness’ by applying the UNFCCC definition of ‘common, but differentiated responsibility’, which considers the different levels of historical responsibility among countries in contributing to the increase of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, leading to climate change.</li>
<li>The climate change mitigation actions should not reverse the social and economic trends, but contribute to the socioeconomic development of the Republic of Armenia. These actions must be based on an ‘ecosystem approach’, which is preferred by the Republic of Armenia, since it allows to maximize the synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions in most sectors of the economy, facilitating fair regional cooperation and contributing to solidarity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="1_INDC_underlying_principles_15"></a>1. INDC underlying principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Limit global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to such a level that the global average temperature does not exceed 2°C</li>
<li>Ensure distribution of the GHG emissions limitation burden between countries based on the principle of equity, taking into account the rights of present and future generations to use resources, and the equal rights of humans to impact the climatic system.</li>
<li>Apply an ecosystem-based approach to mitigation and adaptation actions, giving preference to balanced and combined actions.</li>
<li>The Republic of Armenia stays in the status of non-Annex I developing country under the UNFCCC , and is prepared to undertake certain quantitative contribution to limit its GHG emissions growth based on the above mentioned principle of equity, and subject to adequate financial, technological and technical support.</li>
<li>The INDC shall be based on the principle of ‘Green economy’ and be compatible with the social and economic development goals of the Republic of Armenia.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="2_Mitigation_of_climate_change_22"></a>2. Mitigation of climate change</h3>
<p><h4><a id="1_Applied_definitions_23"></a>1) Applied definitions</h4></p>
<p>a. GHG emissions limiting volume - the total volume of GHG emissions, which ensures the limitation of an increase in the average global atmosphere temperature to below 2°C, according to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report this is equal to 1.000 giga tons (Gt) carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>b. GHG neutral emissions volume - the total annual volume of GHG emissions, which can be fully absorbed by the earth’s ecosystems (ocean, land vegetation, soil) and be irreversibly accumulated in the ecosystems (around 11 Gt/year) carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p><h4><a id="2_Calculation_basis_28"></a>2) Calculation basis</h4></p>
<p>a. The ‘GHG limitation quantitative indicator’ is calculated based on the per capita emissions of the global population,<br>
b. For global population consider the fixed estimate as of 1990, equal to 5.3 billion people (3.35 million was the Republic of Armenia’s population in 1990),<br>
c. The per capita emissions limiting volume on the global levels equal to 189 tons/ per capita (1.000 Gt/5.3 billion people)<br>
d. To set the total aggregate quantitative contribution of the Republic of Armenia under INDC equal to <strong>633 million tons carbon dioxide equivalent</strong> (189 tons per capita x 3.35 million people) for the period of 2015-2050 or an annual average of 5.4 tons per capita. In 2010, Armenia’s GHG emissions comprised 2.14 tons per capita.</p>
<p>The Republic of Armenia strives to achieve ecosystem neutral GHG emissions in 2050 (2.07 tons/per capita annual) with the support of adequate (necessary and sufficient) international financial, technological and capacity building assistance.</p>
<p>In case of non-exceeding its total emissions quota (633 million tons) set for the period of 2015-2050 Armenia can credit non-utilized reduction to ‘carbon market’, or transfer it to the balance of emissions limitation envisaged for the period of 2050-2100.</p>
<p><h4><a id="3_Timeframe_39"></a>3) Timeframe</h4></p>
<p>The timeframe for the INDC is 2015-2030, including:</p>
<p>a) 2015-2019 - the period of voluntary preparatory contributions. Accept those contributions, beyond the INDC start date in 2020, as «ambitious actions» in accordance with the development index of the Republic of Armenia, stated by forecast “mitigation measures” scenario of the Third National Communication to UNFCCC". The scenario includes commitments undertaken by the city authorities of the country under the Covenant of Mayors.<br>
b) 2020-2050 - the period of contribution under the new UNFCCC agreement.<br>
c) 2030 - interim review of the mitigation regime, taking into account possible changes of indexes mentioned uner Para 2, points 2) a and b.</p>
<p><h4><a id="4_The_main_sectors_included_in_the_mitigation_contribution_are_46"></a>4) The main sectors included in the mitigation contribution are:</h4></p>
<p>a. Energy (including renewable energy and energy efficiency)<br>
b. Transport (including development of electrical transport)<br>
c. Urban development (including buildings and construction)<br>
d. Industrial processes (construction materials and chemical production)<br>
e. Waste management (solid waste, waste water, agricultural waste)<br>
f. Land use and Forestry (afforestation, forest protection, carbon storage in soil)</p>
<p>Consider 20.1 per cent as an optimal forest cover indicator of the territory of the Republic of Armenia according to the Armenia`s First National Communication to UNFCCC (1998) and Government Decision No 1232 of 21 July 2005 “On Adoption of the National Forest Program of the Republic of Armenia”. To achieve that indicator by 2050 and consider the obtained organic carbon absorptions and accumulations in the INDC and expand the impact period up that measure till 2100.</p>
<p>Ensure organic carbon conservation, accumulation and storage in all categories of lands through comprehensive measures and include achieved balance in the INDC.</p>
<p>Apply the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) format: as well as national and international Measuring Reporting and Verification (MRV) system for implementation of INDC mitigation component.</p>
<p><h4><a id="5_Greenhouse_gases_considered_61"></a>5) Greenhouse gases considered:</h4></p>
<p>Define that considered greenhouse gases are:<br>
a. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>),<br>
b. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>),<br>
c. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),<br>
d. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</p>
<p>The emissions and absorption of mentioned gases are calculated in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent, according to the “global warming potential” defined by IPCC Second Assessment Report".</p>
<h3><a id="3_Adaptation_to_climate_change_70"></a>3. Adaptation to climate change</h3>
<p>Basis and approaches to adaptation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adaptation strategy and contributions are based on the requirement of the UNFCCC Article 2 “Objective”, which stipulates to restrain climate change within timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. Thus, the natural ecosystems adaptation approach in INDC is considered pivotal for Armenia’s adaptation strategy and actions (contributions), and a basis for the development of the national adaptation plan.</li>
<li>The Republic of Armenia embraces the ecosystem approach for adapting to climate change. The approach is in harmony with the environmental policy of the country, can ensure synergy with other international environmental conventions and treaties, will lay the ground for inter-sectoral coordination, and will support establishment of cross-border cooperation and solidarity environment.</li>
<li>Adaptation activities will be prioritized based on the most vulnerable sectors to climate change:<br>
a. Natural ecosystems (aquatic and terrestrial, including forest ecosystems, biodiversity and land cover)<br>
b. Human health<br>
c. Water resource management<br>
d. Agriculture, including fishery and forests<br>
e. Energy<br>
f. Human settlements and infrastructures<br>
g. Tourism</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="4_Technology_transfer_83"></a>4. Technology transfer</h3>
<p>Ensure adequate technological assistance and create a favorable environment for technology development and transfer.</p>
<p>Establish institutional mechanisms to overcome barriers for the introduction of innovative technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including strengthening the system of legal protection of intellectual property right.</p>
<p>Ensure an open and transparent system of technology introduction and transfer as a contribution to the INDC, such as through the cooperation and experience exchange with “Climate Technology Center and Network” (CTCN) and through the establishment of a similar mechanism in the country (ArmCTCN).</p>
<h3><a id="5_Capacity_strengthening_90"></a>5. Capacity strengthening</h3>
<p>Strengthen the operations of Intergovernmental Council on Climate Change, established by the Decision No 955 of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia of 02 October 2012 and its Working Group.</p>
<p>Establish consistent process for professional training and education on climate change-related issues, as well as enhance cooperation at the international and regional levels.</p>
<h3><a id="6_Finance_95"></a>6. Finance</h3>
<p>Develop an appropriate legislative and institutional framework for adequate financial assistance. For this purpose a targeted financial mechanism consisting of two components should be created to finance climate change mitigation and adaptation projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first - internal (domestic) climate revolving civil fund, to be replenished on permanent base by allocations from environmental fees, ecosystem service fees, including “carbon taxing”.</li>
<li>The second - external (international) financial mechanisms with resource provision following the principle of additionality, such as the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environmental Facility, bilateral and multilateral funds, and other sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>The emerging financial mechanism will:<br>
a. Create realistic and operational grounds for establishment and development of the reliable public-private partnerships (PPP),<br>
b. Ensure the right of future generations to ‘use climate resources’.</p>
<h3><a id="7_Transparency_104"></a>7. Transparency</h3>
<p>Transparency of mitigation and adaptation actions will be ensured through:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction of national and international MRV system,</li>
<li>Open and accessible information system, participatory process.</li>
</ol>
<p>The open and transparent cooperation between public service providing bodies and civil society organizations ensured through establishing and strengthening effective legal incentives.</p>
