<p>Skopje, 4 August 2015</p>
<h3><a id="Subject_Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contributions_2"></a>Subject: Intended Nationally Determined Contributions</h3>
<h3><a id="Introduction_4"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Republic of Macedonia, as a party of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is fully committed to the negotiating process aimed at reaching a global agreement applicable to all Parties at the Paris Conference in December 2015. According to this Agreement, all Parties should be able to give their contribution on a fair and equitable basis and in line with their national circumstances, towards achieving the global objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which would prevent an increase in the global temperature of more than 2°С.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Republic of Macedonia is a non-Annex I country to the UNFCCC (developing country) without quantified commitments for reducing the GHG emissions. At the same time, it has a status of a candidate country for European Union (EU) membership, having thus to adhere to the EU Climate and Energy Policy, which actually takes in commitments of the Annex I countries. The Republic of Macedonia, on voluntary basis endeavors to integrate as much as possible both aspects (UNFCCC and EU) in its national reports on climate change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contributions_INDC_8"></a><strong>Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)</strong></h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The Conference of Parties in Lima confirmed the Warsaw decision that all Parties should prepare their INDC in a manner that would ensure clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Republic of Macedonia, in agreement with the Decision No. 42-17/91 of the 91st Session of the Government held on 28 July 2015, intends to give the following contribution to the global efforts for GHG emissions reduction (Macedonian INDC):<br>
<strong>To reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels combustion for 30%, that is, for 36% at a higher level of ambition, by 2030 compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels combustion cover almost 80% of the total GHG emissions in the country with a dominant share of the following sectors: energy supply, buildings and transport.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In line with the Lima Call for Climate Action, in particular paragraph 14, the Republic of Macedonia shall submit the following information for its INDC, presented in detail in a Background Document, which is an integral part of this submission (uploaded on <a href="http://www.klimatskipromeni.mk/Default.aspx?LCID=302">http://www.klimatskipromeni.mk/Default.aspx?LCID=302</a>, <a href="http://www.moepp.gov.mk">www.moepp.gov.mk</a>).</p>

<p><h5><a id="Scope_18"></a>Scope:</h5></p>
<p><strong>Climate Change Mitigation</strong><br>
Due to the extensive use of fossil fuels, particularly the dominant share of domestic lignite for electricity production, there is a significant potential in the country for GHG emissions reduction. Having this in mind, the focus of the Macedonian INDC is put on climate change mitigation, that is, on policies and measures which lead to GHG emissions reduction. However, this does not suggest that adaptation is less important. Vulnerable sectors and climate change adaptation shall be subject to a more detailed analysis in the future, from the point of view of INDC needs.</p>

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions projections</p>
<p>According to the BAU scenario (WOM), CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2030 will almost double (from about 9 000 kt they will increase to about 18 000 kt). With the 17 measures included in the mitigation scenario (WЕМ), in 2030 a reduction of 30% compared to the BAU scenario can be achieved. Further on, with the higher ambition mitigation scenario (WАМ), which includes improved and additional measures, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction compared to the BAU scenario in 2030 shall be 36%. In all scenarios the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions shell have a growing trend, peaking between 2030 and 2032. In 2030, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions shall increase for 31% under WEM scenario, that is, for 20% under WAM scenario, compared to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1990.</p>

<p><h5><a id="Investments_needed_134"></a>Investments needed:</h5></p>
<p>In the <strong>period 2015-2030</strong>, the <strong>additional investments</strong> (relative to BAU scenario) needed for realization of the mitigation scenario are estimated at <strong>4.2 billion Euros</strong>, while for realization of the higher ambition mitigation scenario they are estimated at <strong>4.5 billion Euros</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides on national investments, the implementation of the national mitigation policies and measures shall also depend on the <strong>involvement of the private sector (national and international) and on the access to new sources of finance and enhanced international support to be mobilized through new climate finance mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund</strong>.</p>
<p><h5><a id="Use_of_international_market_mechanisms_139"></a>Use of international market mechanisms:</h5></p>
<p>The Republic of Macedonia is <strong>following the negotiations</strong> within the UNFCCC’s Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on a framework for establishing a <strong>New Market Mechanism</strong> - NMM as well as for establishing <strong>non-market approaches</strong> - NMA. Once the definition of these concepts is agreed, the Republic of Macedonia <strong>shall consider potential linkage to its national mitigation actions</strong>.</p>

<p><h5><a id="Key_stakeholders_155"></a>Key stakeholders:</h5></p>
<p>The process for determining the Macedonian INDC was led by the <strong>Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MOEPP)</strong>, as the national institution responsible for climate change policies and national contact point for UNFCCC. The <strong>National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) and the Technical Working Group at the National Sustainable Development Council</strong> were also part of this process, as well as <strong>other key stakeholders</strong> – the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Transport and Communication as institutions which are responsible for policies in the target sectors, representatives of the business community, civil society organizations and the academic community. Also, the <strong>international institutions and donors</strong> in the country had important role, primarily the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) which provided technical and financial support for this process. The analysis and the technical component of the process were carried out by an <strong>expert team</strong> which included the team of the Research Center for Energy and Sustainable Development of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, one national expert and one international expert.</p>
<p><h5><a id="Most_recent_strategic_and_planning_documents_in_the_target_sectors_158"></a>Most recent strategic and planning documents in the target sectors:</h5></p>
<p>On a strategic level, through the key challenge of the National Sustainable Development Strategy titled “Climate Change and Clean Energy”, it is required to integrate climate change mitigation into the energy planning. Further on, in the Energy Strategy, in the chapter analyzing the energy sector in Macedonia in the light of sustainable development, the strong connection between energy sector and climate change has been recognized. Further coordination with the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, as the institution responsible for climate change, is required, as well as appropriate harmonization of the strategic and legislative solutions in the energy field with the strategic and legislative solutions for climate action. In order to identify specific mitigation policies and measures, the following documents have been taken into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy Strategy</li>
<li>Energy Efficiency Strategy</li>
<li>Strategy on Renewable Energy Sources</li>
<li>The Program for Implementation of the Energy Strategy</li>
<li>Energy Efficiency Action Plan</li>
<li>Action Plan on Renewable Energy Sources</li>
<li>Transport Sector Strategy</li>
<li>Pre-Accession Economic Program</li>
<li>Program of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia</li>
<li>The Third National Communication on Climate Change</li>
<li>First Biennial Update Report on Climate Change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roles of the stakeholders:</strong><br>
Consultations took place at technical meetings (with senior representatives of line ministries and appointed contact persons) and at topical workshops with all stakeholders. Workshops were held on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification and validation of possible mitigation policies and measures in the target sectors</strong> in agreement with the sector policies and planning documents, as well as with the European Policy on Climate and Energy</li>
<li><strong>Discussion about and validation of the assumptions used for the modelling</strong> of the identified policies and measures in line with the sector policies and planning documents as well as with the European Policy on Climate and Energy</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization of identified measures and providing directions for development of mitigation scenarios</strong> with existing and with additional measures</li>
</ul>

<p>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per GDP of the Republic of Macedonia are similar to the figures of Bulgaria and Estonia. In the BAU scenario, this indicator shall be reduced from 1.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/2005 USD to 1.1 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/2005 USD, while in the mitigation scenarios the values in 2030 shall be reduced to 0.76 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/2005 USD, and to 0.7 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/2005 USD, respectively, which actually marks the <strong>gradual transition to low-carbon economy</strong>. This reduction trend is similar to the trend present in Poland and Romania. According to this indicator, the Republic of Macedonia, in 2035 shall reach the 2012 level of Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia and other countries in this group with values of around 0.4 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/2005 USD.</p>

<p>The Republic of Macedonia is in the same group with the European countries with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita – Lithuania, Portugal, Sweden and Hungary. In the BAU scenario there is a growing trend while in the mitigation scenarios, this indicator in 2035 would be at the same level as in 2012.</p>
