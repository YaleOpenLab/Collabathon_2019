<h2><a id="INFORMATION_0"></a>INFORMATION</h2>
<h2><a id="To_the_United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change_UNFCCC_on_the_Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contribution_INDC_of_the_Republic_of_Azerbaijan_1"></a>to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the Republic of Azerbaijan</h2>
<p>As a developing country, Republic of Azerbaijan believes that the climate change is a potential threat for humanity and supports the adoption of a new Global Agreement on climate change to be applied to all Parties in the 21st Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Paris late 2015.</p>
<p><strong>By 2030 the Republic of Azerbaijan targets 35% reduction in the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990/base year as its contribution to the global climate change efforts.</strong></p>
<h3><a id="Approaches_and_principles_applied_for_defining_the_contributions_7"></a>Approaches and principles applied for defining the contributions:</h3>
<p><strong>Compliance with national conditions and historical responsibility</strong></p>
<p>By communicating its INDC to the UNFCCC, Azerbaijan confirms the importance of a new agreement in the field of climate change and expresses its solidarity with the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan believes that the exchange of information between the Parties on the INDC will assist in streamlining joint efforts aimed at the prevention of global temperature increase above 2°C as it is stated in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as further promote the principles of justice by taking into account the potential and national circumstances of the Parties and their capacity.</p>
<p>When Azerbaijan was part of the former Soviet Union environmental concerns were neglected for the sake of industrial development.</p>
<p>The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict resulted in the occupation of 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan by Armenia and the inflow of a million refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). In addition, the conflict inflicted heavy damage on the environment of Azerbaijan. 1.7 million hectares of land that currently remain under Armenian occupation are comprised of 595.6 thousand hectares of agricultural land, 247.4 thousand hectares of forest area and 10.1 thousand hectares of farmland. 247.352 hectares of forest area, including 13197.5 hectares of rare and valuable forests, 152 natural monuments and 5 geological objects located in the occupied territories have been destroyed. Large scale arsons regularly committed by the Armenian military forces in the occupied territories seriously damage environment and livelihoods in adjacent districts as well as in the entire region. The inflicted damage amounts to billions of US dollars.</p>
<p><strong>The principle of justice and ambition, obstacles and risks</strong></p>
<p>As a developing country Azerbaijan is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. National greenhouse gas emissions account for only 0.1% of global emissions, while per capita gas emissions for 2010 equal 5.4 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent.</p>
<p>Despite the existing challenges, as a developing country Azerbaijan, has already provided its contribution to the global efforts to cope with climate change and has chosen its development direction towards low emission development that requires more financial resources. Therefore, the submitted INDC presents a highly <strong>ambitious commitment.</strong></p>
<p>The increase of the population of Azerbaijan by approximately 1.1% or 100 thousand people per year projected in the official national statistics will increase the demand for energy and other natural resources. This represents one of the main challenges for the reduction of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>In addition, constraints for the implementation of the present INDC and specific risks for the country could be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remaining occupation of the 20 % of the territory of Azerbaijan and consequently problems of one million refugees and IDPs, massive plunder of natural resources and other wealth, as well as extermination of flora and fauna in the occupied territories;</li>
<li>Declining prices of oil in the global markets.</li>
</ul>
