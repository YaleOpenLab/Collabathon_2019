<p><strong>The Russian Federation</strong>, recalling the statements of the Russian Federation at the UN Climate Summit in September 2014 and at the 20th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Lima in December 2014, as well as the Decision 1CP/.20 of the Conference <em>Lima Call for Climate Action</em>, i.e. para 13, which contains the invitation to all Parties to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so), <strong>presents its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) and clarifying information</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the final decision of the Russian Federation on the INDC in the framework of the new climate agreement will be taken pursuant to the outcome of the negotiating process underway throughout the year of 2015 and the INDCs announced by major emitters of greenhouse gases.</p>
<h3><a id="INDC_6"></a>INDC</h3>
<p><strong>Limiting anthropogenic greenhouse gases in Russia to 70-75% of 1990 levels by the year 2030 might be a long-term indicator, subject to the maximum possible account of absorbing capacity of forests.</strong></p>
<h3><a id="Base_year_9"></a>Base year</h3>
<p>1990</p>
<h3><a id="Time_frames__periods_for_implementation_12"></a>Time frames / periods for implementation</h3>
<p>1 January 2020 — 31 December 2030</p>
<h3><a id="Scope_and_coverage_15"></a>Scope and coverage</h3>
<p>Economy-wide, in particular, as determined by decisions of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties on reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy;</li>
<li>industrial processes and products use;</li>
<li>agriculture;</li>
<li>land use, land-use change and forestry;</li>
<li>waste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The INDC indicator is to be achieved with no use of international market mechanisms.</p>
<h3><a id="GHGs_25"></a>GHGs</h3>
<p>The INDC includes information on the following<br>
GHGs:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Carbon dioxide (СО2);</li>
<li>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>);</li>
<li>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O);</li>
<li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);</li>
<li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs);</li>
<li>Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>);</li>
<li>Nitrous trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>).</li>
</ul></p>
<h3><a id="Planning_processes_and_forecasts_39"></a>Planning processes and forecasts</h3>
<p>The Russian Federation currently has in force legally-binding instruments aimed at providing for limitation of the GHG emissions to at most 75% of 1990 levels by the year 2020 (Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of 30 September 2013 and Act of the Government of the Russian Federation of 2 April 2014 No. 504-p). These acts provide, inter alia, for organization of GHG emissions forecasting at the economy-wide scale and for each individual sector. The Russian Federation will further elaborate and adopt legislative and regulatory acts providing for achievement of the stated INDC target by 2030 based on the provisions of the Climate Doctrine and the Energy Strategy of the Russian Federation.</p>
<h3><a id="Methodological_approaches_used_in_particular_for_measurement_and_verification_of_anthropogenic_GHG_emissions_and_in_appropriate_cases_their_absorption_42"></a>Methodological approaches used, in particular, for measurement and verification of anthropogenic GHG emissions and, in appropriate cases, their absorption</h3>
<p>Methodological approaches are based on using the following methodologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPCC 2006 Guidelines;</li>
<li>IPCC 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol;</li>
<li>IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Russian Federation will use global warming potential values as contained in Decision 24/CP.19 of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties.</p>
<h3><a id="Consideration_of_fairness_and_ambition_based_on_national_conditions_50"></a>Consideration of fairness and ambition based on national conditions</h3>
<p>GDP of the Russian Federation in 2012 amounted to 172.9% of the 2000 level while the GHG emissions (without land use, land-use change and forestry) had reached only 111.8% of the 2000 level. Thus, as the GDP was growing significantly at that time period, the increase in GHG emissions was minimal. The economic growth and GHG emissions can be definitively decoupled upon achievement of the earlier announced indicator, i.e. limitation of the GHG emissions to at most 75% of 1990 levels by the year 2020, and the INDC announced for 2030. There will be GHG emissions reduction per GDP unit. At the same time, if contribution of the Russian forests is fully taken into account, limiting GHG emissions to 70-75% of 1990 levels by the year 2030 does not create any obstacles for social and economic development and corresponds to general objectives of the land-use and sustainable forest management policies, raising the level of energy efficiency, reducing energy intensity of the economy and increasing share of renewables in the Russian energy balance.</p>
<p>Russian boreal forests have global significance for mitigating climate change, protecting water resources, preventing soil erosion and conserving biodiversity on the planet. Russia accounts for 70% of boreal forests and 25% of the world’s forest resources. Rational use, protection, maintenance and forest reproduction, i.e. forest management, is one of the most important elements of the Russian policy to reduce GHG emissions.</p>
<h3><a id="How_the_INDC_contributes_to_achieving_the_ultimate_objective_of_the_Convention_Article_2_59"></a>How the INDC contributes to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention (Article 2)</h3>
<p>Reducing GHG emissions by 25-30% from 1990 levels by 2030 will allow the Russian Federation to step on the path of low-carbon development compatible with the long-term objective of the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. This objective can be achieved with efforts of all Parties of the future climate agreement.</p>
