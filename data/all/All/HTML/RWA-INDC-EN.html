<h3><a id="INTRODUCTION_6"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Rwanda, known as the “land of a thousand hills” is a landlocked country of 26,338 square kilometres, geographically located in Central Africa between 1°04’ and 2°51’ of south latitude and between 28°45’ and 31°15’ of east longitude<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. The country has seen significant economic development in recent years, with GDP growing at an average of over 8% annually over the last decade and targeted to reach 11.5 % under the medium term development implementation framework EDPRS II<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. It has a population of 10,515,973 people <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> which is growing at 2.8% per year. Important to note however is that Rwanda’s fertility rate has reduced from 6.1 in 2005 to 4.2 in 2014 and that food crop production growth has grown more twice that of the population between 2007 and 2014 while per capita income has tripled from US$ 211 in 2001 to US$ 718 in 2014<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. A vision for 2050 based on the Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy envisages Rwanda as a developed climate-resilient, low carbon economy, with a strong services sector, low unemployment and low levels of poverty. It would be a country where agriculture and industry have a minimal negative impact on the environment, operating in a sustainable way, and enabling self-sufficient basic necessities for all living in it. By 2050, development will be achieved with low carbon domestic energy resources and practices, reducing the country’s contribution to climate change while allowing it to be independent of imported oil for power generation. Finally, Rwanda will have the robust local and regional knowledge to be able to respond and adapt to changes in the climate and the resulting impacts.</p>
<p>Rwanda is pleased to submit this INDC to replace the preliminary INDC submitted to the Convention in September 2015. This affirms the country’s commitment to engage in the forthcoming international process of developing a climate change agreement.</p>
<p>Rwanda has been committed to addressing the challenge of climate change since 1998 when it ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and later the Kyoto Protocol in 2003. The country submitted its Initial National Communication to the UNFCCC in 2005, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) in 2006, and the Second National Communication in 2012. The Third National Communication is under preparation.</p>
<p>Rwanda’s INDC is built upon its National Strategy for Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Strategy. The full implementation of this strategy rests upon five enabling pillars: Institutional Arrangements; Finance; Capacity Building and Knowledge Management; Technology, Innovation and Infrastructure; and Integrated Planning and Data Management.</p>

<td colspan="2">Seasonal shortages of food supply as a result of poor harvests caused by droughts and flooding and soil erosion are among the most significant signs of how the agriculture sector is vulnerable to climate change in Rwanda. In order to adapt to this situation, Rwanda intends to mainstream agro ecology technologies in its current agriculture intensification programme and other natural resource-based livelihood programmes. 100% of the households involved in agriculture production will be implementing agro forestry sustainable food production by 2030.</td>

<td>1.2 Utilising resource recovery and reuse through organic waste composting and wastewater irrigation;</td>
<td colspan="2">The steep nature of Rwanda’s topography coupled with very high population density (415 inhabitants / km<sup>2</sup>)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> leads to several pressures on natural resources, including land, and this remains the main reason for land degradation. Arable lands also show little tolerance when it comes to climate change effects like heavy rains and draughts. In fact, heavy rains lead to soil erosion resulting in fertility decline and low productivity. Rwanda intends to promote recovery and reuse of both organic waste and wastewater in order to restore and maintain soil fertility. Organic waste use through composting, currently used at a small scale, will be implemented to reach 100% of the households involved in agriculture production countrywide by 2030. Waste water irrigation, mainly practiced in correction centers under national prisons services will be implemented countrywide by 2030.</td>

<td colspan="2">Rwanda relies on imported inorganic fertilisers for its agriculture intensification activities. For instance, 36000 Mt of these were imported in 2014 and these importations are likelly to increase in the near future. Although good at increasing yields, intensive use of inorganic fertilisers has adverse impacts to the environment in general and climate change in particular. In contrast, the use of organic fertilisers by composting has many environmental benefits whereby it provides an excellent way to manage the huge volume of organic waste and utilise it in a productive manner.The effectiveness of composted organic waste can be further improved by enriching and blending it with nutrients (Nitrogen phosphorus). This technique ensures a more efficient use of inorganic fertilizers, and adds valuable organic matter to soils, which also maximizes terrestrial carbon in farm soils. Rwanda intends to ensure the use of fertilizer enriched compost and shift from using pure inorganic fertilizers by 2030</td>

<td>1.4 Mainstreaming sustainable pest management techniques to control plant parasites and pathogens</td>
<td colspan="2">Increasing average temperatures, changes in precipitation and water shortage are seen as climate change aspects that result in pests and diseases proliferation. In order to adapt to this, Rwanda intends to promote sustainable pest management techniques that incorporates a cropping system based on producing multiple crop and fodder yields but which is also designed to control plant parasites and pathogens such as stemborers and striga weed. Rwanda also intends to implement push-pull system using Napier grass and desmodium legume to manage pests under maize, sorghum, millets and rain- fed rice plantations. The main adaptation benefits of the push-pull system are the increase of yields, soil fertility improvement through nitrogen fixation and provision of a continuous supply of fodder to cattle from the harvest of Napier grass and desmodium. Thisimproves milk yields of cattle while reducing methane emissions as a result of improved fodder regimes.</td>

<td>2.1 Add value to agricultural products through processing to meet its own market demand for food stuffs;</td>
<td colspan="2">Food stuff distribution faces challenges when it comes to rural community market places where traded commodities can be damaged under extreme weather conditions. Rwanda intends to expand local markets by constructing market infrastructure, including roofed market facilities, serviceable road and transport networks, developing decentralized village-based agricultural processing centers that incorporate low-carbon sources of energy, such as biogas- digesters and solar driers, and decentralized compost plants.This forms a conduit for agricultural- based trade based on less food miles for regionally and internationally imported food products.Strengthening local markets will also build economic resilience in rural areas that is less dependent on linear commodity flows of raw goods leaving rural areas unprocessed and without added value.Group based organizations involved in agriculture production and running agro processing facilities were estimated at 10% of the total operating group based organizations in 2014. The target is for this percentage to increase by up to 90% by 2030. Also the installed capacity of agro processing installations is to reach 1,200,000 MT by 2030 from 400,000 MT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> in 2014. In addition, Rwanda targets to have 100% of farmers with access to services for post harvest treatment and storage of food crops and reduce post harvest losses to at least 1% by 2030 from 10.4%, 27.4% and 8.3% in 2014 formaize, beans and rice respectively.

Since 2002, there have been consistent gap in wood products supply and demand with deficits reaching 12 million cubic meters in 2009. This deficit shows how the forest sector is and likely to remain under pressure. In order to deal with this main issue, Rwanda intends to improve the management of its forest resources by increasing efforts in using quality germplasm, planting trees at the right time (rain season) and improving post-planting care,. Furthermore, the country intends to use mixed-species approaches which contribute greatly to the achievement of both mitigation objectives and adaptation benefits of ecosystem resilience and biodiversity. Through this strategic action, the country’s target is to achieve an overall 30% sustained forest cover of the total national land surface by 2030 from 28.8% in 2013.</td>

<td>Industrial emissions are mainly resulting from non efficient technologies that are being used by plants during the production process. As Rwanda pursues industrialization and development, under the BUA scenario, the industrial sector is expected to be the fastest growing sources of GHG emissions.</td>
<td>Under the mitigation scenario, Rwanda is committed to achieve energyefficiency by starting with agro- processing industries as large consumers of wood fuels. By 2030, Rwanda intends to avoid total GHGemission reductions of 146,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>efrom Tea and Coffee industries. This action will focus on e energy efficiency improvements through the installation of less energy intensive equipments and technologies for drying, roasting packaging, improvements of water efficiency through loss minimization, recycling and reuse.</td>

Development of such industrial parks will require significant energy and the concept of establishing green industrial parks will focus onreducing the carbon footprint of goods produced in these industrial zones through a greater use of renewable, energy efficient technologies and shared resources.</td>
<td>Rwanda will establish Eco- Industrial Parks / Green Industries Complex where following principles will be applied:The production of goods and services in the industrial park must, at a minimum comply with defined standards;Any CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that remains after consideration of heating, cooling, fixed lighting and ventilation must be less that or equal to a pre defined carbon compliance limit. Any remaining CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,from regulatedenergy sources must be reduced to zeroThe actual emission reduction potential can vary greatly based on the actual level of low carbon technologies implemented and in implementing “zero-carbon” principle, the emission reduction potential can be as high as 80-100% compared to a baseline based only on carbon intensive energy source.</td>

<td>Rwanda will apply a Sustainable Charcoal Value Chain to reduce the demand of wood in charcoal production and downstream activities, leading to a potential net reduction in wood use ofapproximately 5,770,000 tbetween 2016 –2030 (equal to5,770,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>saved).</td>
