<p>The <strong>Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis</strong> is a democratic and sovereign country. The impacts of Climate Change are global and St. Kitts and Nevis, along with the International community are committed to addressing the adverse effects. In addition, climate change is one of the most critical issues facing the Caribbean region and it is already being experienced through rising sea levels, increasing mean temperatures and changes in rainfall and weather patterns. All these impacts, in many ways, affect the socio-economic development of the country in sectors such as St. Kitts and Nevis Tourism, Agriculture and Water.</p>
<p>St. Kitts and Nevis sustainability, as a nation, is dependent upon the collective and global response to aggressively reduce St. Kitts and Nevis Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). In this regard the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis proposes an emissions reduction target of 22% and 35% of St. Kitts and Nevis GHG emissions projected in the business as usual (BAU) scenario for 2025 and 2030 respectively.</p>
<p>The National Conservation and Environmental Protection Act (NCEPA) articulates strategic approaches to environmental protection, and serves as a framework for the declaration of sensitive ecological and historic sites that presents clearly vulnerability to climate change and vulnerability.</p>
<p>The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, hereby communicates its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC) towards achieving the UNFCCC objective as set out in Article 2 of the Convention, and in accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.</p>

<p>St. Kitts and Nevis proposes to reduce its GHG emissions by focusing on electricity generation and the transport sector. Under its proposed mitigation actions it is intended that the policies and measures would increase the use of renewable energy sources by 50%, taking into consideration that this ambitious target could be considered risky within the short time frame. To reduce the risk St. Kitts and Nevis must ensure that the relevant policies and measures are created within its natural, financial, technological and human resources to implement the measures necessary to achieve the intended emissions reduction</td>

<h2 id="adaptation-contribution">ADAPTATION CONTRIBUTION </h2>
<p>The Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis is committed to building resilience and mitigating the negative impacts of external shocks including natural disasters, according to NCEPA, and many others institutional and regulation requirement that have been developed in the country.</p>
<p>For St. Kitts and Nevis the most vulnerable sectors and areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forestry and Terrestrial Ecosystems</li>
<li>Coastal Ecosystems</li>
<li>Water resources</li>
<li>Human Settlements</li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Tourism</li>
<li>Human Health</li>
</ul>
<p>Climate change is one of the major threats for key vulnerable sectors that are linked to vital pillars for sustainable development. Forestry and water supply are intimately linked to potable water, tourism, and agriculture. Moreover, St. Kitts and Nevis, a twin island state, is abundant in nearshore and marine resources which provide the basis for a range of economic and social activity relevant to the tourism and fishing industries. Some of these marine resources include coral reefs, beaches, mangroves, freshwater lagoons and sea-grass beds. Tourism, water supply and coastal infrastructure, are also being affected by the sea-level rise, saline intrusion and flooding.</p>
<p>St. Kitts and Nevis wishes to highlight three areas in its iNDC that are considered important to its social and economic sustainability and their interlinkages with others sectors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Coastal zone</li>
</ul>
<p>St. Kitts and Nevis plans develop a comprehensive plan to build resilience in the following sectors:</p>
<p><img src="KNA-3.png" width="930" height="456" /></p>
<p><img src="KNA-4.png" width="737" height="333" /></p>
<p><img src="KNA-5.png" width="739" height="360" /></p>
<h2 id="implementation-support">IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT </h2>
<p>St. Kitts and Nevis is aware of the importance of developing a comprehensive plan which must serve as the preparation stage for the implementation process.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the effective implementation of the plan proposed above, the local actors must be involved and therefore empowered and prepared to execute the necessary tasks. The preparation process may require, <em>inter alia,</em> technical training, capacity building workshops, expert guidance, and feasibility and technical studies. It is important to highlight the relevance of the institutional capacity, as well as the necessary establishment of institutional coordination and political support to meet the desired national goals. Furthermore, technical and economically feasibility studies for all levels of implementation (actions, projects, programs, policies), as well as a comprehensive analysis for policy implication would be required. It is also relevant to prepare a sectorial financing plan with specific funding sources and disbursement planning to implement the necessary policies and measures.</p>
