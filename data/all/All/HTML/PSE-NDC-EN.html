<p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</p>
<h2 id="national-context">1. National Context</h2>
<p>This document summarises the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of the State of Palestine.</p>
<p>The State of Palestine recently gained accession to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On the 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2016, it officially became the 197<sup>th</sup> party to the Convention and, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of April 2016, signed and ratified the Paris Agreement which entered into force on the 4<sup>th</sup>of November 2016.While the State of Palestine’s priority on climate change is adaptation, it is also committed to ensuring that its emissions pathway is in line with the objective of the UNFCCC to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>
<p>The State of Palestine recently completedits Initial National Communication Report<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></a>(INCR) and submitted it to the UNFCCC on November 11<sup>th</sup> 2016 highlighting its commitment to being an active player in tackling and responding to climate change. In addition, the State of Palestine also recently developed its National Adaptation Plan (NAP)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>,in accordance with the UNFCCC’s Consultative Group of Experts guidelines for least developed countries, and on November 11<sup>th</sup> 2016 became the sixth country to have submitted their NAP to the UNFCCC. The period between joining the UNFCCC and submitting the INCR and NAP is less than eight months,highlighting the importance of climate change within the Palestinian national agenda.</p>
<p>The State of Palestineconstitutes the Occupied Palestinian Territory,based on the borders of June 1967, and comprises the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, which areseparated by Israel. The State of Palestine’s population increased from 1.5 million in 1980 to 4.0 million in 2010 and is expected to reach 8.9 million by 2050. In addition to the 4 million Palestinians living in Palestine, more than 6.5 million Palestinians are refugees and living abroad and cannot exercise their right to return to their homes because of the Israeli Occupation. Nearly one-third of registered Palestinian refugees, more than 1.5 million people, live in 58 recognised Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and within the State of Palestine.</p>
<p>The country is under Israeli occupation, and Israeli settlements have been established throughout the West Bank including East Jerusalem. Consequently, the Palestinian Government does not have control over its own territory and natural resources, which are subject to systematic and widespread Israeli violations, and the Israeli occupation has a negative impact on the delivery of the Palestinian Government’s environmental policies. The Gaza Strip has suffered from a siege and blockade imposed by Israel, for the past ten years, which has severely affected the viability of living conditions, decreased their resilience and reduced their adaptive capacities to the adverse impact of climate change</p>
<p>The State of Palestine is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with severe implications for its economy, living standards and environment.The NAP identifies a wide range of ‘highly vulnerable’ issues across 12 themes/sectors. Many of these issues have inter-connections more generally across themes/sectors, most notably, in relation to water, agriculture, food and energy.Israeli occupation, along with the illegal settlements regime, annexation and expansionWall substantially reduces the State of Palestine’s adaptive capacities in relation to many issues across all themes/sectors thereby compounding climate vulnerabilities.The NAP identifies and prioritises adaptation options in relation to all ‘highly vulnerable’ issues.</p>
<p>In an holistic effort to improve conditions, the Palestinian Government alsodeveloped a National Development Plan 2014-2016<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> with policies and strategies designed to establish the sovereign state, consolidate its control over its natural resources, develop Area C<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> (particularly in the Jordan Valley), and restore East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The plan also signalled the State of Palestine’s determination to boost its national economy, bolster its economic independence, and enhance the private sector’s ability to build its productive capacity, its competitiveness and ability to create jobs for its people. The National Development Plan continues national endeavours to strengthen institutions, ensure financial stability and deliver quality public services efficiently and sustainably. Moreover, the Environment Quality Authority (EQA) led the preparation and development of the Environment Sector Strategy (2014-2016) with the vision of: “A protected, maintained and safe Palestinian environment that achieves sustainability of natural resources, under an independent Palestinian sovereignty.” Sectoral strategies (2017-2022) have been developed for 21 sectors in total, including: water, agriculture, energy and waste among others. Three sectors were considered cross-cutting: environment, gender and Youth. These include strategic goals some of which are linked to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation. As such, the NDC builds upon the INCR, the NAP, and is in line with the National Development Plan and the recently developed sectoral strategies to achieve sustainable economic development in line with emissions reduction.</p>
<p>The delivery of the climate actions described in this NDC will help achieve a number of national development and policy objectives as well reflects the country's vision for climate action and address the political commitment to climate change at a global level. These include improvements in the State’s energy security, with a reduced dependence on imported electricity from Israel and increased energy reserves through development and exploitation of the Gaza Strip’s gas field. Improvements in the Palestinian people’s living conditions, health and environment, through better air quality, less unmanaged waste, increased food production and increased water resources are also important cobenefits. These actions will also support the implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The State of Palestine’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts will be crucial to the ability to achieve, by 2030, not only SDG 13 on combating climate change, but a number of other SDGs such as SDG 1 on ending poverty in all its forms, SDG 3 on good health and well-being, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation, and SDG 7 on affordable and clean energy among others. Hence, implementing NDCs can support the achievement of the sustainable development goals across all sectors and levels of government.</p>
<p>The NDC has been developed by a multi-stakeholder engagement process building on the stakeholder engagement undertaken to develop the INCR and NAP and with high-level political endorsement by the Palestinian Government.</p>

<h3 id="fairness-and-ambition">2.3 Fairness and ambition</h3>
<p>The State of Palestine’s emissions per person are extremely low. In 2011, there were 0.8tCO<sub>2</sub>eq per capita per year<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>, forecasted to grow to 1.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq per capita per year in 2040 under the independence scenario or 1.2 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq per capita per year under the status quo scenario. This is significantly less than the global average of 7.58 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>percapita per year. Moreover, the State of Palestine’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was approximatelyUS$ 2,800 in 2011 and is forecast to be US$ 9,400in 2040 under the independence scenario or US$ 7,400 in 2040 under the status quo scenario. This is also significantly less than the global average of US$ 10,400 GDP/capita in 2011<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>. However, despite the State of Palestine’s small share of global greenhouse gas emissions and low level of economic development, the Palestinian Government is committed to making a fair and ambitious contribution to global efforts to limit emissions consistent with the objectives of the UNFCCC. The Palestinian Government reaffirms its belief in the principles of equity, and of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.</p>
<p>Given that the State of Palestine is not a high emitter, and is very vulnerable to climate change impacts, the NDC is ambitious in putting forward a quantified emission reduction contribution. The State of Palestine’s NDC is also ambitious in light of the country’s challenging political circumstances.The Israeli occupationobstructs the State of Palestine’s ability to implementadaptation and mitigation activities. It is difficult for the State of Palestine to have full control over its emissions profile, as it is almost entirely dependent on imported energy from Israeldue to political and logistical factors. In addition, the occupation prevents the State of Palestine having control of its own borders in the West Bank, including east Jerusalem,andGaza Strip, which impacts on Palestine’s resilience to climate change.The occupation has also made information sharing and networking at a national level very difficult, impacting on the Palestinian Government’s ability to address climate change challenges. The flow of information, cooperation and coordination between staff members that work on climate change in both the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip is hindered by road blocks, check points and the inability to move freely between both areas.</p>
<p>The NDC is also ambitious given that the State of Palestine has only been a party to the UNFCCC since March 2016. Despite being the newest State Party to the UNFCCC, in less than 9 months the State of Palestine has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement, developed and published its INCR and NAP, and submitted its NDC to the UNFCCC.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation">3. Adaptation</h2>
<p>Adaptation to adverse impact of climate change is considered as the highest priority. The State of Palestine’s NAP was approved by all relevant ministries in May 2016. All stages of Element A (‘Lay the groundwork and address gaps’) and Element B (‘Preparatory elements’) described in the UNFCCC’s NAP Guidelines for Least Developed Countries have been completed; in addition the NAP sets out a replicable approach for monitoring and evaluation of the adaptation actions in the NAP. The State of Palestine aims to maintain the NAP as a living document, and is intent on driving forward implementation of the NAP, subject to <strong>securing appropriate international support</strong>.</p>
<p>The NAP identifies‘highly vulnerable’ issues in relation to the following 12 theme/sectors: agriculture, coastal and marine (Gaza Strip only), energy, food, gender, health, industry, terrestrial ecosystems, tourism (West Bank only –because Israel’s occupation and blockade of the Gaza Strip prevents opportunities for tourism), urban and infrastructure, waste and wastewater, and water. Many of these issues have inter-connections more generally across themes/sectors, most notably, in relation to water, agriculture, food and energy. Israeli occupation substantially reduces the State of Palestine’s adaptive capacities thereby compounding climate vulnerabilities. For example, Israeli occupation of the State of Palestine restricts availability of land and resources, freedom of movement, import and export of raw materials and products, and the development of domestic and industrial infrastructure. These limitations on the State of Palestine’s adaptive capacities are most prevalent in the so-called Area C, which covers 61% of the occupied West Bank, and in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The State of Palestine’s particular circumstances mean that the NAP is focused on the implementation of immediate, near-future adaptation actions that address highly vulnerable themes/sectors under Israeli occupation. However, the NAP also gives limited consideration to medium- and long-term adaptation actions that could be taken if the Israeli occupation was resolved. The adaptation actions aim to reduce climate sensitivity or increase adaptive capacity in relation to each of the highly vulnerable issues across the 12 themes/sectors, and take into consideration national development goals.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, adaptation actions have been identified that are relevant to three future-climate scenarios for the State of Palestine that are representative of all projections considered in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. Such actions will, therefore, be beneficial whichever of the scenarios comes to pass.</p>
<p>Under the most pessimistic scenario in the NAP, should emissions continue to increase with some reductions from historic level but breaching the 2°C target, the below impacts are expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature increases (by about 1.5°C by 2025, 2.5°C by 2055 and 4.5°C by 2090)</li>
<li>Reduced cold periods and more warmer periods, both becoming more prominent over time</li>
<li>Decreased rainfall overall (up to around 20% less by 2025, 15% by 2055 and 30% less by 2090), but also extended dry periods, reduced wet periods and heavier rainfall days. This presents an overall increase in drought risks, as well as an indication that the rare wettest days might become more frequent, especially in the West Bank, and hence potentially increase flood risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 5below summarises the issues that are ranked as highly vulnerable to climate change for each of the themes/sectors. The complete vulnerability assessments for all themes/sectors in relation to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are available on request from the Environment Quality Authority.</p>

<p>The adaptation actions in the NAP comprise management and operational strategies, infrastructural changes, policy adjustments or capacity-building. Some actions involve adjusting (climate-proofing) current activities, while others are new, or require major transformations in operations. Some are ecosystem-based, i.e. helping people adapt to the impacts of climate change through the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of ecosystems. A full list of costed adaption actions for each of the sectors is presented in the means of implementation section.</p>
<p>In addition, Palestine unconditionally commits to undertake the specific adaptation actions set out in Table 6below. Many of these reflect adaptation actions that will be undertaken locally, but need to be scaled up and implemented more widely or currently under implementation across the State of Palestine, as set out in the NAP and summarised in seeTable 9.</p>

<h2 id="planning-processes">4. Planning processes</h2>
<p>The implementation of the NDC will require effective governance to drive progress, ensure accountability, coordinate decision-making processes and maintain political will at all levels. This includes supporting sectors with the planning and implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions, the assessment and communication of financing and support needs (nationally and internationally), and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) related to NDC implementation. It will involve further mainstreaming of mitigation and adaptation within economic development, promoting mitigation and adaptation actions, improving cooperation among ministries, and mobilising support for mitigation and adaptation actions.</p>
<p>MRV of NDC implementation will include tracking the implementation of mitigation and adaptation activities, assessing the impacts (greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas) of mitigation and adaptation activities, as well as tracking climate finance (both national and international) flows. The State of Palestine aims to integrate the necessary MRV activities into existing processes and structures for international reporting to ensure an efficient and consistent approach.Palestine is in the process of determining the most appropriate process for MRV of NDC implementation and is intending to implement a robust MRV system.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Government has chosen the Environment Quality Authority to be the single national entity responsible for driving the implementation of the NDC, and reporting on progress on NDC implementation. The State of Palestine has a National Committee on Climate Change, which is a cross-ministerial expert advisory committee. Its aim is to support the Palestinian Government in the implementation and evaluation of its climate policies. It advises on where attention is required with regard to risks and on mitigation and adaptation needs. The National Committee on Climate Change, on behalf of the Palestinian Government, is responsible for preparing climate-related policies, and following decisions by the Cabinet, and monitoring implementation of these policies. The Environment Quality Authority will be given the responsibility to coordinate NDC implementation at the national level and between sectors.</p>
