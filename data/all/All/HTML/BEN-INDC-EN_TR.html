<h1 id="expected-contributions-determined-at-level-national-indc">EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS DETERMINED AT LEVEL NATIONAL (INDC)</h1>
<p><em>September 2015</em></p>
<p><strong>RESUME EXECUTIVE</strong></p>
<p>The Nationally Determined Planned Contributions (CPDN) of the Republic of Benin are based on measures contained in its National Poverty Reduction and Management Programs Climate Change, whose overall objective is to contribute to sustainable development and resilience to climate change by providing adequate solutions to the challenges of climate change.</p>
<p>Based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving different stakeholders (public institutions, private sector, civil society), the CPDN of Benin situates the country's progress in the fight against climate change by 2030 in order to contain The increase in global warming below 2 degrees Celsius as recommended by the international community.</p>
<p>In the area of mitigation, Benin expects to reduce overall cumulative greenhouse gas emissions (excluding forestry) from the business-as-usual scenario by about 21.4% over the period 2021 to 2030.</p>
<p>The share of national efforts is about 16.4% and that of the conditional contribution is 83.6%. Implementation of the envisaged measures could also contribute to increase the cumulative carbon sequestration capacity of Benin compared to the scenario of maintaining the status quo of 5.7% over the period 2021-2030 by reducing the annual rate of deforestation Of natural forests by 41.7%. Under this objective, the unconditional contribution is in the order of 24.6% and the conditional contribution is approximately 75.4%. Moreover, reducing the annual deforestation rate by 41.7% could enable Benin to reduce its cumulative emissions from the forestry sector compared to the business-as-usual scenario of about 110 Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub> over the period 2021-2030. The share of the unconditional contribution towards achieving this objective is around 20% and that of the conditional contribution is 80%.</p>
<p>Compared to adaptation, the levels of vulnerability of the Republic of Benin at the national level are generally average and sometimes high. All livelihoods and livelihoods are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The main sectors concerned are agriculture, water resources, forestry, coastal zone, human health and energy. The main objectives of the CPDN are to reduce the vulnerability of socio-economic systems and ecosystems to climate variability and change by adopting appropriate policies and measures. It will therefore be necessary to strengthen climate risk and early warning systems for food security in vulnerable agro-ecological zones, to increase the availability of water resources, especially during dry periods, to protect the coastal zone facing Sea level rise and contribute to the financing of adaptation at the local government level through the strengthening of local governance in the planning and budgeting of activities.</p>
<p>In order to realize its ambitions to mitigate Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and adapt to the adverse effects of Climate Change, the Republic of Benin will need a global financial envelope of around 30 billion US dollars of which 2.32 billion as contribution of the Government of Benin over the period from 2021 to 2030. The shares that return to the mitigation and adaptation measures are respectively 12, 13 and 18,35 billion dollars US.</p>
<p>This report on the CPDN, which cannot be exhaustive, is dynamic and could therefore be refined in the light of new data and information. The Strategy for Sober Development in Carbon and Resilient to Climate Change being developed as well as the National Adaptation Plan offer opportunities to operationalize the commitments contained in this document.</p>
<h3 id="i.-national-circumstances">I. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</h3>
<p>The Republic of Benin is located in West Africa in the Gulf of Guinea between latitudes 6°30' and 12°30'N and longitudes 1° and 3°40'E. It covers an area of 114 763 km<sup>2</sup>. With an average annual population growth rate of 3.5%, its population is estimated at about 10.725.000 inhabitants for the year 2015.</p>
<p>Two types of climate govern the country: the subequatorial climate in the South and the continental tropical climate in the North.</p>
<p>Benin is a developing country whose economy relies mainly on agriculture, trade and transport with neighboring countries. This characteristic justifies the high values of GHG emissions estimated for agriculture and transport compared to other sectors in 2000. Despite the economic efforts, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains below the minimum rate of 7% required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
<p>Climate change is a global phenomenon with consequences at the national and local levels. This phenomenon is a concern of the Government of Benin, which develops actions on the basis of clearly defined objectives and orientations through state structures, local authorities, the private sector and civil society organizations. These actions concern, inter alia:</p>
<ul>
<li>institutional aspects through the creation of the Ministry of the Environment in charge of Managing Climate Change in Reforestation and Protection of Natural and Forest Resources (MECGCCRPRNF), the Directorate General for Climate Change (DGCC), the National Fund For the Environment and Climate (FNEC) and for the establishment of the National Climate Change Management Program (PNGCC), the setting up of the National Committee on Climate Change (CNCC), the setting up of the Commission Economic Modeling of Climate Impacts and Integration of Climate Change in the General Budget of the State (CMEICB);</li>
<li>Operational aspects of adaptation, mitigation and capacity-building at national and local levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to implement the recommendations of the 1992 Earth Summit (Rio de Janeiro), Benin created the National Commission for Sustainable Development (CNDD) and developed its National Agenda 21. This national sustainable development policy document includes long-term orientations, actions, objectives and means of implementation to promote sustainable development.</p>
<p>In this regard, Benin has set the following priorities: (i) reducing poverty in close connection with the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (PRGS3); (Ii) maintaining a high level of economic growth; (Iii) integrate environmental issues into development policies, strategies, plans, programs and projects.</p>
<p>Like other Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Benin remains a country that is particularly vulnerable to climate variability and change. Through its commitment to the implementation process of the The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as well as other States Parties, the Republic of Benin has the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce the vulnerability of socio-economic systems and ecosystems to climate variability and change by adopting lower-cost policies and measures;</li>
<li>promote policies and measures to mitigate climate change;</li>
<li>develop initiatives on mitigation and adaptation for sustainable development;</li>
<li>participate in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;</li>
<li>promoting the transfer of technology and the necessary expertise in adaptation and mitigation to climate change;</li>
<li>to promote scientific and technological research in the field of adaptation and mitigation to climate change</li>
</ul>
<p>This document has been prepared under the supervision of the Ministry of the Environment in charge of Climate Change Management, Reforestation and Protection of Natural and Forest Resources (MECGCCRPRNF) with the support of the French Development Agency (AFD ) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), using a participatory approach involving a group of national experts from the National Committee on Climate Change and experts from AFD as well as other key actors at the national level. representatives of sector ministries, civil society organizations and the private sector. It integrates data and information collected from these actors and has been validated and adopted by the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>The document focuses on two main themes, namely Mitigation and Adaptation, including cross-cutting issues.</p>
<h3 id="ii.-mitigation">II. Mitigation</h3>
<p>The Republic of Benin is one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) whose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are estimated at about 6.3 Mega tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub>) or about 1 tonne E-CO<sub>2</sub> per capita in 2000, Land Use, Land Use Changes and Forestry (LULUCF) excluded. These emissions come mainly from the agriculture and energy sectors whose contributions are estimated at 68% and 30% respectively (Figure 1).</p>
<p><img src="BEN-1.png" width="545" height="209"/></p>
<figcaption>Figure 1: Contribution of each sector to overall GHG emissions in Benin in 2000.</figcaption>
<p>Taking into account the LULUCF sector, the emission balance (6.3 Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub>) and removals (11.3 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) of GHG shows that Benin is globally a GHG sink with an absorption capacity of 5 , 1 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> in 2000, that is to say that its GHG emissions are largely offset by the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> at the level of its forest cover. Although Benin remains a well, its capacity for carbon sequestration and even CO<sub>2</sub> absorption at the level of its vegetation cover is decreasing, from (-16.5) Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub> in 1990 to (-11, 3) Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2000, a decrease of 31%, and at -9.6 Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2005, a decrease of 40%.</p>
<p>The assessment of trends in total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) and emissions in the agriculture and energy sectors in the context of maintaining the status quo on the 2000-2030 time series is reflected in Figure 2 .The trend of global emissions shows an increase of 258.3%, that of the agricultural sector of 178.1% and that of the energy sector of 321.0% during this period. Total cumulative GHG emissions without any intervention over the period 2021-2030 is close to 193 Mt E-CO<sub>2</sub> (excluding LULUCF).</p>
<p><img src="BEN-2.png" width="555" height="331" /></p>
<figcaption>Figure 2: Trends in aggregate emissions and emissions in agriculture and energy (2000-2030)- business as usual scenario.</figcaption>
<p>The trend of global emissions and emissions in key sectors from 2000 onwards shows the need to take mitigation measures without compromising economic and social development priorities (Figure.2). Many opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions have been identified for this purpose.</p>
<p>At the institutional level, the creation of a Department for the Mitigation of Climate Change and Promotion of the Green Economy at the Ministry in charge of Climate Change and the Directorate of New and Renewable Energies at the Ministry in charge of Energy, Offers a technical framework for promoting and coordinating actions. At the operational level, the sectors of agriculture and energy, including transport, carry the main levers of action. Compared to the energy sector, there is a wide margin for improving energy efficiency, converting production sources (natural gas, photovoltaic solar power, hydroelectric power) and energy consumption, Energy and logistics "Transport". There is also a strong potential for improvement of the technical, cultural and forestry routes in the agricultural sector. The "Sustainable Cities", "Light for All" and "Low Carbon Development" projects, in the course of design or development with the support of the AFD and other partners, will constitute additional opportunities when they are implemented. In the LULUCF sector, the implementation of sustainable natural forest management and the strengthening of reforestation / plantation efforts offer opportunities to reduce the regression intensity of the carbon sequestration capacity of ecosystems Forests in Benin.
<p>Based on the above considerations, Benin in its submission presents a contribution to GHG mitigation based on measures contained in strategies, programs and projects for the period 2021-2030 with a specification of the sectors of activity and GHGs considered. The main sector strategies and objectives for contribution development, as well as the methodological assumptions and approaches are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 and illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5.</p>

<h3 id="iii.-adaptation">III. ADAPTATION</h3>
<p>Adaptation in the context of climate change refers to initiatives, measures, actions to reduce the vulnerability of natural systems and socio-economic systems.</p>
<p>In Benin, taking account of adaptation in the CPDN is justified by the fact that it is a national priority in terms of the country's vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. Moreover, the measures hitherto implemented only concern urgent short-term adaptation actions and are therefore not aimed at the medium and long term.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the CPDN for adaptation in Benin is to increase efforts to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change in human systems, to increase the resilience of ecosystems in the context of global warming Climate change.</p>
<p>Work carried out in the context of the joint assessment of vulnerability to climate change in the most vulnerable geographical areas of Benin (NAPA, 2008)</p>
<ul>
<li>Drought, floods and late and violent rains constitute three major climate risks in Benin;</li>
<li>High; winds and excessive heat are also two climatic risks that may be of great importance in certain localities, in certain situations</li>
<li>The occurrence of localized climatic risks, such as sea-level rise, with little geographical influence but capable of major economic and social impacts</li>
</ul>
<p>In the central and northern agro-ecological zones, (i) watersheds, subsistence agriculture and water resources, and (ii) smallholder farmers, market gardeners and emerging farmers, and fishermen are heavily exposed Climate risks.</p>
<p>In the agro-ecological zones of the south (i), subsistence agriculture, land, water resources, human health and biodiversity, and (ii) smallholder farmers, fishermen and herders are more exposed Climate risks.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all means and livelihoods are affected by climate change, at different scales and levels. All the key sectors of the vulnerability / adaptation problem are: agriculture including livestock and fisheries, forestry, water resources, coastal zones, human health, energy, etc. According to the Second National Communication of Benin on Climate Change (DCN, 2011), the trends observed show that the interannual variability of rainfall during the period 1951-2010 was characterized throughout the country by short deficit periods Alternating with some short excess periods. In the southern region, the largest deficits were recorded almost everywhere in 1977 and 1983 (drought years), while the largest rainfall surpluses date back to 1988, 1997 and 2010 (years of flooding). In the northern region, 1958, 1977 and 1983 had the largest rainfall deficits, while in 1988 and 1998 the greatest rainfall surpluses were recorded in many localities. As for spatial variability, it is generally less pronounced or relatively low in areas outside the coast.</p>
<p>With regard to temperature, the deviations from the mean are substantially in the range of -0.6 ° C to + 0.8 ° C. The pattern of average annual temperatures observed during the period 1961-2010 does not show a clear upward or downward trend.</p>
<p>In sum, while on an annual basis, the analysis of the current climate does not reveal any significant trends in rainfall variations. On the other hand, the seasonal analysis reveals large differences in the post-1971 period.</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, the above-mentioned manifestations of climatic risks have led to numerous impacts, in particular the decline in agricultural yields, the disruption of agricultural calendars, the decline in water levels in drinking water dams, and the prolongation of the low-water period and the submergence of banks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerability levels at the national level are generally moderate and sometimes high.</li>
<li>As for future impacts, the 2015, 2025, 2050 and 2100 time horizons were chosen to integrate the socio-economic and ecological effects of climate change (DCN, 2011) using appropriate models. Projections include:</li>
<li>A continuous sea-level rise of up to about 0.81m by 2100 with direct effects of coastal flooding and the intrusion of saline waters into watercourses and bodies of water. This could affect human settlements, health, fishing activities;</li>
<li>A probable decrease in runoff of surface water by 2050 over the entire Ouémé River basin under a scenario of reduced rainfall in the north of the country;</li>
<li>A shift in flood times in the Beninese portion of the Niger basin, following a significant decline in seasonal rainfall;</li>
<li>Lower maize yields in some agro-ecological zones;</li>
<li>A decline in the productivity of fishery resources that could lead to a decline in catches and a depletion of fish stocks at the national level</li>
</ul>
<p>The main objectives are to reduce the vulnerability of socio-economic systems and ecosystems to climate variability and change by adopting appropriate policies and measures.</p>
<p>The main targets are vulnerable communities in the country's eight agro-ecological zones.</p>
<p>Initiatives have been implemented through public awareness, development and implementation of adaptation measures such as the establishment of agro-meteorological systems, promotion of agricultural practices resilient to climate change, the implementation of the Early Warning System, the development of low-lying areas and the development of capacities of various stakeholders (national and local levels).</p>
<p>The implementation of these initiatives has received support from several sources, including the National Budget, the National Environment and Climate Fund (FNEC), the LDCF Funds of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), German cooperation, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UMEOA), the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the United Nations Development Program Research for International Development (IDRC).</p>
<p>The main gaps and barriers to adaptation relate mainly to limited technical expertise, insufficient and high quality data and information, inadequate institutional reforms, inadequate financial resources, virtually non-existence of legislative and regulatory texts Adaptation to climate change, inaccessibility to appropriate technological resources, etc.</p>
<p>In view of the gaps and barriers mentioned above, the needs for the implementation of adaptation activities across all sectors relate mainly to strengthening technical expertise on methodologies and tools for assessing impacts and vulnerability and The formulation of adaptive responses, improvement of institutional capacities, technological needs (climate monitoring and prediction system, appropriate adaptation technologies in various socio-economic sectors, etc.), and financial resources. The main strategies and plans / programs adopted by Benin to reduce its vulnerability under the CPDN are set out in Table 2 in the Annex.</p>
<p>In the area of ​​monitoring and reporting, a list of indicators will be established and a monitoring mechanism will be put in place to periodically inform these indicators and to assess progress in meeting the adaptation targets. The NAP process offers the opportunity to make the monitoring and evaluation elements concrete.</p>
<h4 id="iv.-ambition-and-equity">IV. AMBITION AND EQUITY</h4>
<p>The Republic of Benin is one of the least developed countries (LDCs) whose GHG emissions are estimated at about 1 t CO<sub>2</sub> per capita in 2000 and largely offset by carbon sequestration at national forest cover. Its emissions are therefore insignificant compared to global emissions. In spite of this a very negligible responsibility in global warming and its situation in LDCs, Benin has adopted a climate change management program that includes all actions in the field of climate change management. Through the implementation of its contribution, Benin will strengthen its potential for carbon sequestration at national forest cover while its cumulative emissions will be regressing compared to the reference year by 2030. Efforts are under way to combat atmospheric pollution through the improvement of traffic fluidity (construction of specific works of type exchangers at major intersections, development of cycle paths, development of pedestrian ways) particularly in the city of Cotonou, exemption from tax and customs duties on 4T motorcycles and their parts detached to the detriment of 2T motorcycles, the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing rail network for the development of public transport despite the pressure exerted by these measures on its budget. In the energy sector, biomass energy (fuelwood, charcoal) is the most consumed form of energy in Benin. The country depends on the outside for its supply of commercial energies (petroleum products and electricity). The measures envisaged in the CPDN, while at the same time targeting the welfare of populations, are directed towards less polluting energies and energy saving, in particular energy efficiency, electricity production from sources Renewable energies despite the additional costs they generate.</p>
<h3 id="v.-institutional-framework-for-implementation">V. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
<p>The contribution of Benin will be implemented under the aegis of the Ministry in charge of Climate ChangeWhich assumes the role of National Focal Point of the United Nations Framework Convention on Changes Climate change with the effective participation of all stakeholders (sectoral ministries, local authorities, private sector, civil society, etc.)</p>
<p>The National Committee on Climate Change (CNCC) and the Commission for Economic Modeling of the Impacts of Climate and the Integration of Climate Change in the General Budget of the State (CMEICB) constitute decision-making bodies and Monitoring of the implementation of the CPDN.</p>
<p>Benin, in its National Climate Change Management Program, has developed a level of organization for monitoring and evaluation of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in order to equip the program with a national steering committee (CNCC), A departmental and communal guidance committee and intersectoral technical commissions, which provide general guidance, monitoring of climate vulnerability and adaptation / mitigation actions to climate change.</p>
<h3 id="vi.-means-of-implementation">VI. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
<p>The activities envisaged in the framework of the implementation of the CPDN of Benin require financial means, technological and capacity building.</p>
<h4 id="technology-transfer-requirements">6.1- Technology Transfer Requirements:</h4>
<p>With regard to technological resources, emphasis will be placed on endogenous technologies and South-South and North-South transfers, including the necessary know-how. The main identified technology transfer needs are in the agriculture / forestry, energy, waste and transport sectors (Table 3).</p>
