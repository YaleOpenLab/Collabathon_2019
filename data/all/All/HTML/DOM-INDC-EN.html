<h1><a id="DOMINICAN_REPUBLIC_2"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</h1>
<h2><a id="INTENDED_NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_4"></a>INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION</h2>
<h2><a id="INDCDR_5"></a>INDC-DR</h2>
<p>The vision of the Dominican Republic for 2030 states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Dominican Republic is a prosperous country, where people live with dignity, attached to ethical values and in the context of a participatory democracy that guarantees the social and democratic rule of law and promotes equity, equal opportunities, and social justice, and that manages and uses its resources to develop in an innovative, sustainable and territorially balanced and integrated way, competitively inserted into the global economy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the realization of this vision, the 2030 National Development Strategy (NDS) articulates public policy in several key areas of development. This strategy promotes the transformation of society to a culture of sustainable production and consumption, which manages risks with equity and efficiency, protection of the environment and natural resources, and promoting adequate climate change adaptation. This is a huge challenge given national circumstances, territorial conditions and environmental features that add to and exacerbate the challenges imposed by climate change.</p>
<p>As a highly vulnerable country, the Dominican Republic aspires to achieve a global agreement that limits the increase in global average temperature to 2°C, with progressive reduction to 1.5°C, based on the scientific consensus.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic’s intended nationally determined contribution has been designed based on national capacities, envisaged financing conditions and national circumstances.</p>

<td><b>The reference point</b></td>
<td>The base year is 2010. Base year estimated emissions are 3.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>e <em>per capita</em></td>

<tr>
<td><b>Quantifiable emissions reduction target (conditional)</b></td>
<td>Reduction of 25% of base year emissions by 2030. This reduction is conditional upon favorable and predictable support, feasible climate finance mechanisms, and corrections to the failures of existing market mechanisms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Time frames and/or periods for implementation</b></td>
<td>The implementation period is 2010-2030, with a review every five years. The post 2030 contributions will be established at the end of the NDS period.</td>

<em>Coverage</em>: Nation-wide</td>

<tr>
<td><b>Planning processes</b></td>
<td>Planning processes will be based on the NDS, the National Policy on Climate Change, the Climate-Compatible Development Plan (CCDP), and the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA-DR).These instruments articulate public policy on strategic areas where indicators have been established for the decarbonization of the economy and society, and relevant aspects for effective climate change adaptation. Furthermore, multisectoral consultations have identified specific actions for climate change adaptation and mitigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Assumptions and methodological approaches</b></td>
<td>The methodologies to be used correspond to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for Conducting National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and assume the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values for a residence period in the atmosphere of 100 years of the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC. </p>
<p>As the NDS indicates a vision for the country to be competitively inserted into a global economy, there is potential to participate in carbon market mechanisms. The development of carbon markets must ensure environmental integrity both nationally and internationally. </p>
<p>Land Use and Land Use Change have implications in terms of emissions and absorptions, whose quantification will be used to achieve the objectives within the national contribution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Fairness andambition</b></td>
<td>The proposed level is ambitious. The Dominican Republic is a middle-income country, however, it faces a number of development challenges, such as: poverty, education, health, security, etc., that exacerbate the challenge of adaptation and decoupling emissions from the economy. </p>
<p>In terms of emissions, the Dominican Republic represents less than 0.1% of global emissions. Per capita emissions are below the average for Latin America and the Caribbean region (4.9 tCO<sub>2</sub>e). However, the emissions trends of some economic sectors are important, especially transport, energy, manufacturing and construction, waste and agriculture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Adaptation</b></td>
<td>Adaptation is a constitutional priority for the country. The sectors identified as most vulnerable are: Drinking Water, Energy (power generation component), National System of Protected Areas, Human Settlements and Tourism.</p>
<p> The elements of the strategic planning approach to adaptation are:<ul>
<li>Ecosystem-Based Adaptation /Resilience of Ecosystems</li>
<li>Increase of Adaptive Capacity and Decrease of Territorial / Sectoral Vulnerability</li>
<li>Integrated Water Management</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Food Security</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Floods and Droughts</li>
<li>Coastal and marine areas</li>
<li>Risk Management and Early Warning Systems</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Loss and Damage</b></td>
<td>As a small island developing state, and being located in an area of intense hurricane activity, the Dominican Republic is threatened constantly by hydro-meteorological events such as tropical storms, droughts and hurricanes affecting human settlements and productive activities. </p>
<p>Damage associated with hydro-meteorological events over the years has left a trail of effects demanded beyond considerable efforts. In 1998, Hurricane Georges caused losses and damages equivalent to 14% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997. The tropical storms Olga and Noel in 2007 forced the government to adjust its priorities and the economy, causing losses and damages of 1.2% of GDP and 5.3% of the national budget. Additionally, the damage caused by many otherdisasters including floods, landslides and droughts have not been quantified.</p>
<p>The impacts of some extreme events have meant economic losses in the order of USD 9,470 million, and the most affected sectors have been: agriculture, transportation, energy, housing, education, industry and trade, sanitation, drainage, health and environment. These statistics refer to major events that cause disasters, but smaller and recurrent events can cause major damage to property, livelihoods and crops. However, certain gaps in the historical record of medium and small events persist, and the amount is estimated to be equal to half of the loss and damage of the biggest events.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Financing</b></td>
<td>For the water sector, the incremental cost of adaptation with reference to a baseline scenario for theperiod 2010-2030, reaches an amount of USD 2,792.5 million (2005 dollars), representing an average of 0.48% of the GDP projected for that period. The tourism sector will have to face the consequences of hydro-meteorological phenomena in the coming years. To combat this, it is estimated that the sector will need incremental financial flows of USD 358.3 million (2005 dollars) for the period 2005-2030.</p>
<p>In terms of mitigation, CCDP’s implementation has an approximate cost of USD 17,000 million (2010 Dollars) in the energy, transport, forestry, tourism, solid waste and cement sectors for the period 2010-2030; to achieve emission reductions in the order of 25 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e. These costs are associated with the identified measures that have mitigation potential, not with structural measures to modify or promote an enabling environment in these sectors.</p>
<p>The National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resources and Skills to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development identifies financing needs that exceed USD 1.5 million per year for projects of Higher Education, Technical-Vocational education and specializations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Technology Needs</b></td>
<td>The country has developed a Technology Needs Assessment (TNA), which identified a number of measures and technologies whose implementation is compatible with the NDS, CCDP and the NAPA-DR.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Gender perspective</b></td>
<td>Aware that climate change will impact vulnerable groups of people in different ways, the gender perspective is a cross-cutting issue in the national development model. Therefore, the role of women as agents of change is recognized, and their participation is encouraged in the transformation of society towards a low-carbon and resilient development.</td>
