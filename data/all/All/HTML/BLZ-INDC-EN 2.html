<h1><a id="BELIZE_0"></a>BELIZE</h1>
<h2><a id="INDC_1"></a>(INDC)</h2>
<p>Submitted to the UNFCCC on 1 October, 2015</p>
<h3><a id="1_National_Context_5"></a>1. National Context</h3>
<p>Belize is a small country with relatively minor contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions and has limited capacity to contribute to mitigation of global climate change. However, Belize is committed to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention and supports the even more ambitious target to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. In light of these realities, the country has made significant strides towards fulfilling the objectives of the Convention through the development and implementation of new policies, projects and programmes and the implementation/strengthening of existing policies, regulations and projects geared towards GHG emissions abatement and overall low carbon development.</p>
<p>Belize is pleased to submit the first draft of its INDCs andis made on behalf of the government of Belize by the Climate Change Focal Point, without prejudice to the pending Cabinet consideration of the INDCs for which the outcome of Cabinet consideration may be different to the one submitted. Belize intends to utilize existing frameworks, policies, projects and activities that provide mitigationand sustainable development co-benefits to conceptualize the elaboration of its INDCs.</p>
<h3><a id="2_Belizes_Mitigation_Potential_12"></a>2. Belize’s Mitigation Potential</h3>
<p>Belize’s mitigation potential will largely depend upon national circumstances, capacity and support. Belize’s emissions profile is symptomatic of several factors including:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Vast extent of natural resources - a network of waterways and water bodies including 16 watersheds and numerous smaller ones), approximately 69 % remains under natural vegetation while 39.1% of the terrestrial area is made up of protected forests, and a great variety of terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystemsi;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Socio-economic dependence on those resources for livelihood and for sustaining economic growth particularly through agriculture and tourism sectors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rapidly growing population (with over a third in poverty and a largely unskilled labor force).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concomitantly increasing energy demands</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Belize has developed several important policy frameworks over the last decade to respond to these issues with: (1) Horizon 2010-2030, (2) National Energy Policy Framework (2012-2017) (3) Sustainable Energy Action Plan 2014-2033 (4) National Climate Resilience Investment Plan (5) Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy 2014-2017 and (6) the National Climate Change Policy, Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2020).</p>
<p>Horizon 2010-2030 is the national development framework that was developed after extensive stakeholder consultation inclusive of all political parties. One of its four main pillars is responsible environmental stewardship. The strategies to achieve this pillar namely integrating environmental sustainability into development planning and promoting sustainable energy for all, address the areas of concern earlier pointed out.</p>
<p>The National Energy Policy Framework aims to provide options that Belize can pursue for energy efficiency, sustainability and resilience over the next 30 years.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Energy Action Plan is a tool to achieve Belize’s renewable energy and energy efficiency potential while meeting the Government’s economic social and environmental goals. It provides a framework of actions and tasks to overcome barriers to sustainable energy for the period 2014-2033.</p>
<p>The National Climate Resilience Investment Plan provides the framework for an efficient, productive and strategic approach to building economic and social resilience and development. Special importance is given to building climate resilience and improving disaster risk management capacities across all sectors.</p>
<p>Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy is the guiding development plan for the period 2014-2017. It adopts an integrated, systemic approach and encompasses medium-term economic development, poverty reduction and longer-term sustainable development issues.</p>
<p>National Climate Change Policy, Strategy and Action Plan (NCCPSAP), 2015-2020, provides policy guidance for the development of an appropriate administrative and legislative framework, in harmony with other sectoral policies, for the pursuance of a low-carbon development path for Belize. In addition, the NCCPSAP also seeks to encourage the development of the country’s Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC) and communicate it to the UNFCCC.</p>
<h3><a id="3__Mitigation_40"></a>3. Mitigation</h3>
<p>The first draft of Belize’s INDCs focuses on its mitigation contribution and is framed on an action-based approach that is dependent on cost effective technology, capacity building and adequate financial support.Belize intends to provide information on adaptation at a later stage.</p>
<p><h4><a id="Information_to_facilitate_clarity_transparency_and_understanding_44"></a>Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding</h4></p>
<p>Decision 1 CP/20 para 11 states that “small island developing states may communicate information on strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission development…”</p>
<p>Belize considers that the upfront information provided addresses sectors with significant contribution to Belize’s greenhouse gas emissions and satisfies the requirement of clarity, transparency, and understanding of the aggregate effect of contributions to the achievement of the 1.5 degree C goal.</p>

<p><h4><a id="3_Fairness_and_Ambition_126"></a>3. Fairness and Ambition</h4></p>
<p>Currently Belize as a Small Island Developing States contributes less than 0.01 percent to the global emissions and accounts for a small share of past and current greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, Belize remains committed to strategically transition to a low carbon and climate resilient future and provides a fair contribution to the global efforts towards reaching a legally binding agreement in COP 21 in Paris.</p>
<h3><a id="Additional_information_132"></a>Additional information</h3>
<p>Belize’s Climate Change Action Plan</p>
<p>Belize’s Climate Change Action Plan focuses on building the capacity and resilience of the country to meet the challenges of climate change. In Belize, like most SIDs, GHG emissions are relatively small, but international commitments as well as opportunities to benefit from associated mitigation initiatives (reduced deforestation and energy conservation) has prompted their inclusion in the development of the National Climate Change Policy Strategy and Action Plan. Agriculture, land-use change and the forestry sector are considered prime areas for Climate Change adaptation but are also known to be contributors to GHG emissions and will require the development of policy initiatives to reduce such threats. The energy and transportation sectors, because of the benefits to be derived through the pursuit of sustainable energy and low-carbon development initiatives, will also require policy initiatives which seek to limit emissions of GHGs. Belize identified the following key sectors for which adaptation and mitigation strategy and action plans will be addressed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Forestry</li>
<li>Fisheries and Aquaculture</li>
<li>Coastal and Marine Resources</li>
<li>Water Resources</li>
<li>Land use and Human Settlements</li>
<li>Human Health</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Tourism</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Solid Waste</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>Enhance Food security and sustainability as per Article 2 of the Convention: Agriculture is critical to Belize’s development, given its importance both in terms of food self-sufficiency, employment, and being one of the country’s major exports and earnings of foreign exchange. Belize has developed a National Agriculture Sector Adaptation Strategy to Address Climate Change in Belize, in order to combat the detrimental effects of Climate Change. These recommendations include both short and long-term measures to address critical gaps in technological developments relevant to crop production, better soil management practices, diversification into drought resistant crops and livestock, and farm production adaptations which include, but is not limited to, land use, land topography and increasing use of low-water irrigation systems.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for planned activities totals approximately USD $13,000,000.</p>
<p>Integrating Climate Change in Revised National Forest plan: Belize is well known for its pristine forests and is reported to have the highest forest cover in both Central America and the Caribbean (62% as a percentage of land, 37% of which are primary forests). However, the forests of Belize (and its biodiversity), like other natural resource sectors, are anticipated to be impacted by the various manifestations of Climate Change. The proposed interventions to mainstream adaptation and mitigation to Climate Change will be achieved by providing guidance for actions that concerns the direct and indirect threats posed by global Climate Change on forests and forest dependent people in order to reduce their vulnerability, increase their resilience and adaptation to Climate Change. The estimated cost for planned activities totals approximately USD 5,158,000.</p>
<p>Sustainable management of the Fisheries Sector: The fisheries sector is important to Belize because it is an important food source, provides an income and livelihood for several persons as well as an earner of important foreign exchange. Given the importance of the fisheries sector as a source of food and earner of foreign exchange, it is imperative that management measures are introduced to ensure its sustainability including addressing the threats of Climate Change. Interventions under the fisheries sector aim to achieve the sustainable management of the fisheries resources, and the conservation and preservation of fisheries resources and marine habitats in promoting reef ecosystem resilience. Estimated cost is approximately USD 500,000-750,000.</p>
<p>Adoption and Implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan: The importance of the coastal zone in the productive sector of Belize is increasing rapidly. Most industries in Belize are either directly or indirectly reliant on some component of the coastal environment to function. Industries such as fishing and tourism are dependent on the organisms that inhabit the coastal area to sustain them. Other industries such as agriculture, aquaculture, and petroleum use the coastal waters to transport their products, thereby allowing them to engage in overseas trade. Rapid economic development, directly attributed to tourism and recreational activities and population growth, have led to increasing pressures on coastal and marine resources, with implications to the livelihoods of those that depend upon them. These anthropogenic threats are compounded by natural hazards, global warming and rising sea levels and the vulnerability of sensitive coastal ecological systems to Climate Change. It is therefore, imperative to ensure that the coastal zone is managed and utilized in a manner that will continue to support important ecological functions, as well as social, cultural and economic prosperity for current and future generations. The overall objective is to promote the adoption and implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan which will ensure responsible and sustainable use of Belize’s coastal and marine resources in the face of Climate Change. The cost of activities to promote the adoption and implementation of the Belize Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan is estimated at approximately USD 500,000 annually.</p>
<p>Improved integrated water resource management: Due to its geographic location, relatively high level of forest cover, and 18 different water catchment areas, Belize is recognized as having an adequate supply of freshwater. However, like other resource sectors, a number of anthropogenic factors (increases in demand due to expansion in the agricultural, industrial and tourism sectors, a growing population and accompanying water pollution and watershed destruction), together with impending threats of Climate Change, are placing a heavy strain on the sustainability of this resource. The overall goal is to enhance the protection and restoration of forest ecosystems and build the resiliency of water catchment areas. Resources including estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Integrate Climate Change in the Tourism sector: In Belize, like most other SIDS, most of the tourist assets are located within the narrow coastal belt and the growth of the industry is perceived as having a potential detrimental effect on the environmental resources on which it is dependent. The goal is to assess the vulnerability of Belize’s tourism system to Climate Change and ensuring the mainstreaming of Climate Change considerations throughout the sector to enhance ecosystem resilience, equitable distribution of tourism activities and fostering of sustainable tourism development, at a local and national scale.</p>
<p>Building resilience of human settlements: The strategy is to promote the adoption of an integrated land tenure and land classification policy and developing and implementing programmes which discourage the establishment of human settlements in areas prone to natural hazards (flooding, land slippages, high winds and storm surges), and develop housing and settlement patterns/practices that enhance Climate Change adaptation and are resilient to Climate Change.</p>
<p>The resources included estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Enhance resiliency of Transportation sector: Several of Belize’s roads and bridges are vulnerable to seasonal floods. Belize’s waterways also become un-navigable during certain periods In the absence of a transport policy, it is imperative that a vulnerability assessment is undertaken with greater focus being placed on assessing the vulnerability of the transport infrastructure, particularly in urban areas and other areas which are critical in sustaining the country’s productive sectors (tourism, agriculture and ports). An improved and energy efficient transport sector will not only reduce the country’s vulnerability to storm surges and floods, but also assist in reducing GHG emission. The resources included estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Strengthened and improved human health: It is important that the Ministry of Health undertake a Vulnerability and Capacity assessment for the health sector. This is important for the country to be well informed of the impacts of Climate Change on the health sector and the adoption of practices and technologies that will reduce exposure and health impacts from extreme heat, and improve physical infrastructure of health institutions and their functional capacity. The resources included estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Improved waste management: Until a few years ago, the uncontrolled dumping and burning of garbage, as a form of final disposal throughout Belize, was quite common. Such practices, compounded by inadequate waste collection systems and the lack of technical and environmental controls have impact on the health of the population and pollution of the nearby ocean, thereby affecting coral reefs and affecting the livelihood of thousands of Belizeans whose livelihoods are directly and indirectly linked to fishing and eco-tourism. The overall goal is to implement a National Integrated Waste Management Programme including programmes to reduce, reuse, recover and recycle solid waste and reduce GHG emissions into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The resources included estimated cost for the following planned activities are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>National Climate Resilience Investment Plan</p>
<p>The Government of Belize developed its National Climate Resilience Investment Plan (NCRIP) that seeks to improve Belize’s climate resilience tosupport the country’s economic growth and safety of its citizen. It is a cross-sectoral plan that identifies both physical and non-physical interventions that take into account current and future risks posed by current and future climate variability. The NCRIP is expected to be integrated by Government of Belize into its Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy and is aligned with the Horizon 2010-2030. The cost of implementation is approximately USD 231.4million.</p>
