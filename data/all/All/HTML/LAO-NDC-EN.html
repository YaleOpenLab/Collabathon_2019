<p> 30 September 2015 </p>
<h2 id="national-context">1 National Context </h2>
<p>Lao PDR has a long term goal for national development which is set out in the 8<sup>th</sup> Five Year National Socio-economic Plan (2016-2020), with a Vision to 2030. According to this vision, the goal is for Lao PDR to make the transition from a Least Developed Country (LDC) to a middle income country by 2030 supported by inclusive, stable and sustainable economic growth whilst alleviating poverty. Lao PDR recognises the strong link between economic development, sustainability and the need to mainstream environmental considerations, including action on climate change into its development plans.</p>
<p>The Climate Change and Disaster Law is being developed and the overarching legal framework for climate change and disaster management is provided in the law. The law is expected to be approved in 2017.</p>
<p>The National Strategy on Climate Change (NSCC) of Lao PDR was approved in early 2010, and states a vision on how to address climate change<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To secure a future where Lao PDR is capable of mitigating and adapting to changing climatic conditions in a way that promotes sustainable economic development, reduces poverty, protects public health and safety, enhances the quality of Lao PDR’s natural environment, and advances the quality of life for all Lao People</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the overarching strategy set out in the NCCS, climate change action plans for the period 2013-2020 define mitigation and adaptation actions in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, land use change, water resources, energy, transportation, industry and public health.</p>
<p>Lao PDR is highly climate-vulnerable, and the country’s greenhouse (GHG) emissions were only 51,000 Gg<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the year 2000, which is negligible compared to total global emissions. Despite this, Lao PDR has ambitious plans to reduce its GHG emissions while at the same time increasing its resilience to the negative impacts of climate change. Examples of such plans include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ambitious target is set out in the National Forestry Strategy to the Year 2020 for increasing forest cover to a total of 70% of land area by 2020, and maintaining it at that level going forward. This will reduce the risk of floods and prevent land degradation, yet at the same time the greenhouse gas mitigation potential of such a target is substantial and long lasting.</li>
<li>In terms of Lao PDR’s large scale electricity generation, the electricity grid draws on renewable resources for almost 100% of its output. Lao PDR also aims at utilising unexploited hydropower resources to export clean electricity to its neighbours. By supplying neighbouring countries such as Cambodia, Viet Nam, Thailand and Singapore with hydroelectricity, Lao PDR is enabling other countries in South East Asia to develop and industrialise in a sustainable manner.</li>
<li>The Government of Lao PDR has also laid the foundations for the implementation a renewable energy strategy that aims to increase the share of small scale renewable energy to 30% of total energy consumption by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<p>Climate change is already causing economic loss and affecting the livelihoods, food security, water supply and health of much of the country’s population. The frequency and intensity of climate related hazards such as droughts and floods are expected to increase in future, so Lao PDR must also urgently take steps to build its resilience by enhancing its adaptation efforts across all sectors. A more detailed summary of the vulnerabilities to climate change and the adaptation actions proposed to address them are discussed further in Section 3 of this INDC.</p>
<p>Lao PDR is committed to the implementation of its NCCS and its sectoral climate change action plans, for the national, regional and global benefit. However, it will require technical and financial support to deliver the mitigation and adaptation actions identified herein. With such support, the NCCS will be most efficiently implemented, the potential GHG reductions identified will be optimised, and Lao PDR can most effectively adapt to the negative and immediate effects of climate change.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation">2 Mitigation </h2>
<h3 id="mitigation-contribution">2.1 Mitigation Contribution </h3>
<p>Lao PDR has identified a number of actions which it intends to undertake in order reduce its future GHG emissions, subject to the provision of international support. These are outlined in Table 1 together with preliminary estimates of the projected emissions reductions which will occur as a result. These estimates have been drawn from a variety of sources and need to be reviewed and updated to address consistency and accuracy in analytical methods once more reliable data and information are available. Details of the mitigation actions, implementation plans and support needs are outlined in Section 4 and Annex 1 respectively.</p>

<h3 id="ambitious-and-fair">2.2 Ambitious and Fair </h3>
<p>Lao PDR’s GHG emissions are very low in the global context, and its historic contribution to climate change has been minimal. Despite this and its status as a Least Developed Country (LDC), the Government of Lao PDR intends to implement policies that support the long term goal of limiting global GHG emissions in line with the objectives of the UNFCCC and the findings of the IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. These represent the first time that Lao PDR has made an international undertaking to take action on mitigation and therefore fulfils the requirements of the Lima Call for Climate Action to go beyond existing efforts.</p>
<p>In order to maximise the ambition of its mitigation contribution while taking into account the need for economic development, Lao PDR has prioritised mitigation actions that both address the main causes of future increases in emissions and also have significant development co-benefits. This is considered to be a fair approach to the nation’s first INDC. Forestry based actions will not only increase the amount of GHG sinks in Lao PDR, but will also provide adaptation co-benefits contributing to prevention of flooding, soil erosion and landslides, protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Improving public transport will not only result in less GHG emissions as a result of travel, but will also improve air quality and support more sustainable economic growth. The rural electrification programme will reduce GHG emissions, promote rural development and reduce poverty. Finally, the export of hydropower to other countries in the region will allow their economies to grow in a more sustainable manner, by replacing consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>This INDC includes a mix of plans which are being undertaken by the Government of Lao PDR including those supported by overseas development assistance. Lao PDR is also implementing other relevant national and local plans such as the allocation of approximately USD 12 million annually for disaster emergency response plans. This demonstrates that Lao PDR is not content to wait for international support to take action on climate change. However, reforestation and maintenance of forests for example is a major challenge for a country such as Lao PDR, so there is strong desire to achieve success with international programmes and assistance such as REDD+ and FLEGT.</p>
<p>Overall, in order to achieve maximum mitigation potential, further international support is required by Lao PDR. The main support needs are as set out in the Section 4 and Annex 1 of this INDC.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation">3 Adaptation </h2>
<p>As set out in the vision for the NSCC referred to in Section 1, Lao PDR intends to balance its need for development without compromising its environment. For climate change adaptation this translates into the following goals which are articulated in the NSCC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase resilience of key economic sectors and natural resources to climate change and its impacts</li>
<li>Enhance cooperation, strong alliances and partnerships with national stakeholders and international partners to achieve national development goals</li>
<li>Improve public awareness and understanding of various stakeholders about climate change, vulnerabilities and impacts in order to increase stakeholder willingness to take actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lao PDR’s economy is already experiencing the impacts of climate change, and the majority of population remains highly vulnerable to climate hazards in particular floods and droughts. This is because Lao PDR’s economy and over 70% of population depends on natural resources for their livelihoods and to ensure food security. The agriculture sector is responsible for 29.9 % of GDP and approximately 70% of the population are dependent on the sector for their livelihoods. Increasing climate resilience with respect to agriculture is therefore a high priority especially food security. Another high priority is the provision and management of water resources as this contributes to social wellbeing, economic productivity and water supply for agriculture, industrial processes and energy production.</p>
<p>Flooding is a major climate risk in the country, threatening livelihoods almost every year. 14 out of 17 provinces as well as the Vientiane capital have experienced floods since 1995. The country’s annual rainfall is expected to increase its variability which, accompanied with increase in temperature could have significant impact on water resources, ecosystems and agricultural production. In addition floods have an adverse impact housing, health and education, industrial activities, and infrastructure (transportation, water and sanitation). As an example the flooding in 2005 caused widespread disruption and the estimated economic costs were USD 29 million<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Lao PDR is also experiencing increasingly frequent episodes of drought. Severe drought occurred in 1996, 1998 and 2003. It is estimated that 6 out of 17 provinces are already at high risk of droughts. Droughts adversely affect water resources, hydroelectricity generation and agricultural production resulting in widespread economic losses.</p>
<p>The National Adaptation Programme of Action (2009) maps out a country-driven programme to address immediate and projected climate change adaptation requirements in the agriculture, forestry, water resources and public health sectors. The adaptation programme was further developed in the NSCC to cover the main sectors of the economy which are identified as the agriculture and food security, forestry and land use change, water, energy and transport, urban development, industry and public health sectors, which are intended for implementation by 2020.</p>
<p>One of the guiding principles of the NSCC is to develop and implement integrated adaptation and mitigation solutions, i.e. that are low-cost, improve energy efficiency, promote cleaner production, and provide adaptation/mitigation synergies as well as economic, environmental and socioeconomic benefits. Hydroelectricity has great potential in Lao PDR providing clean energy, an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and also meet other objectives such as flood, irrigation and water supply management. The forestry sector contributes to both national economy and also livelihoods of many Laotians for example. Sustainable forest management therefore improves the resilience of communities and ecosystems and at the same time reduces GHG emissions by absorbing carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>In order to work towards achieving the NSCC’s vision and goals and effectively implement the climate change action plans for all sectors, development of an M&E system is an immediate need for Lao PDR. Table 2 and Annex 2 reflect the nation’s adaptation priorities given the current understanding of expected climate impacts. These actions will be continuously assessed and improved when monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data and new information about climate change and impacts become available.</p>

<h2 id="indc-development-process-and-implementation-plan">4 INDC Development Process and Implementation Plan </h2>
<p>This INDC has been prepared through an inclusive stakeholder consultation process including line ministries, research institutions, civil organizations, provincial governments, private sector and international development partners. The main sources of information to prepare this document were the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> five year National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-2015 and 2016-2020 , with a Vision to 2030 (2011 and 2015), National Climate Change Strategy (2010), Forestry Strategy to the Year 2020 of the Lao PDR (2005), Renewable Energy Development Strategy (2011), Sustainable Transport Development Strategy (2010), Climate Change Action Plan of Lao PDR for 2013-2020 (2013), National Adaptaion Programme of Action (2009) and the Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2013) and Investment and Financial Flows to address climate change in Energy, Agriculture and Water Sector (2015).</p>
<p>The cross-ministerial National Disaster Management Committee (NDMC) will oversee the overall implementation of the INDC. Using the NDMC’s existing structure, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) will act as secretariat. This will involve coordination with relevant ministries and cooperation with international stakeholders to access finance and capacity building for the implementation of the INDC including the establishment and implementation of MRV.</p>
<p>MoNRE will disseminate the INDC and later the results of the COP 21 to relevant ministries in the central and line agencies in the local levels. The INDC will also be incorporated in the 8<sup>th</sup> National Socio-Economic Development Plan to ensure the continued mainstreaming of climate related policy in overall national plans.</p>
<p>The INDC will be implemented in a coordinated manner with the NCCS, climate change action plans and the sectoral plans. The current climate change action plans run until 2020 and Lao PDR will start devising the next set of action plans to continue to implement the NCCS before the end of the year 2020. Details of the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation actions identified in Sections 2 and 3 of this INDC are set out in Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.</p>
<p>To facilitate the implementation of the INDC and ensure climate change action plans are executed in the most effective, efficient and economic manner, MoNRE will carry out four elements as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overall strategy, coordination of INDC implementation and regulatory framework:</strong> will be established by MoNRE. Effective arrangements for liaison with line ministries responsible for aspects of the INDC, international stakeholders and development partners, at national and local levels to facilitate implementation of the INDC will be put in place. This will also include strengthening the policy and regulatory framework especially continue development and promulgation of the Climate Change and Disaster Law, which is expected to be in 2017. This law will be a continuum for earlier achievements on climate change polices and plans such as the Environmental Protection Law, Revised Urban Planning Law, Strategic Plan on Disaster Management 2020 (2003) and the National Strategy on Climate Change (2010).</li>
<li><strong>Capacity building</strong>: one of the biggest requirements above all is to instigate the development of technical capacity – not just across sectors, but at all levels of engagement from central government decision-makers through to local levels and technical staff. In mitigation capacity building is needed for example in feasibility studies, mitigation analysis and policy development. Regarding adaptation capacity building is needed in understanding the climate change impacts, adaptation measures including technical requirements of the adaptation measures such as drought- and flood-resistant varieties of crops, research into new crops and climate resilient technologies as well as on how the adaptation measures will impact on communities and environments.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> in summary, there are broadly eight main steps that will need to be followed in order to ensure that domestic and international finance is successfully acquired, utilized and accounted for<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Assess needs, define priorities, and identify barriers to investment</li>
<li>Identify policy mix and sources of financing</li>
<li>Identify access routes to multilateral finance</li>
<li>Blend and combine resources</li>
<li>Formulate projects, programmes and sector-wide approaches to access finance</li>
<li>Implementation and execution of planned action</li>
<li>Implementation and management of project coordination systems</li>
<li>MRV / M&E of climate finance</li>
</ol></li>

<p>With respect to domestic resources for climate action, Lao PDR has apportioned USD12.5 million for climate change which represented approximately 0.14% of GDP in 2012. In order to implement the mitigation actions and address adaptation needs international support in the form of financial, technology transfer and capacity building is needed. An initial estimate of the financial needs for implementing identified mitigation and adaptation policies and actions is US$ 1.4 billion<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and US$ 0.97 billion<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, and details are provided in Annex 1 (mitigation) and Annex 2 (adaptation) respectively.</p></li>
<li><strong>Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV):</strong> an MRV system is the cornerstone of effective national implementation as it allows progress against implementation plans to be demonstrated and provides data for learning for future project development. Lao PDR recognises that its capacity with respect to MRV requires development if the climate change goals set out in this INDC are to be realised. Specifically, a GHG inventory system, NAMA MRV framework, adaptation evaluation indicators and tracking systems for climate finance need to be developed. In the immediate term, in order to develop MRV system, Lao PDR intends to carry out the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readiness assessments</strong>: these will identify the current state and barriers on data, organisational arrangements, personnel capacity, national policies, and any existing domestic MRV systems.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity building</strong>: once the readiness assessment is complete, a capacity development plan will be produced and implemented, and tools will be provided in order to carry out MRV inclusively.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
