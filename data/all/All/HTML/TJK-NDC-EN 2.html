<p><strong>The Republic of Tajikistan,</strong> pursuant to the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, COP-19 and COP-20 of the UNFCCC, including the Lima Call for Action to Combat Climate Change (Lima, Peru, December 2014), submits herewith its <strong>Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and the explanations concerned.</strong></p>
<p>The final decision concerning the INDC of the Republic of Tajikistan within the framework of a new global climate change agreement, which will be proposed for signing during the COP-21 (Paris, France, December 2015), is expected to be taken with due account for the outcomes of the negotiating process at this meeting.</p>
<p>The Republic of Tajikistan, as a mountainous and landlocked country with a developing economy and low per capita GDP, is characterized by the low level of gross and specific greenhouse gas emissions and an extreme vulnerability to climate change, including frequent natural disasters. More than 60% of the water resources of the Central Asia Region, which originate from the high mountain glaciers, are generated in the country. Tajikistan adheres to the policy of sustainable development. Since independence, fundamental regulatory and legal instruments, national strategies and programmes have been adopted and the key environmental international conventions and agreements have been ratified, serving on a global scale as a safeguard towards preservation of the natural environment and preventing ecological disasters. With the assistance of the international institutions, measures are being developed and implemented to fulfil the commitments which have been made in accordance with the UN environmental conventions, and the relevant institutional structures are established.</p>
<p>The Republic of Tajikistan is a participating country of the international Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PRCR). At the time of preparation of the INDC, the main efforts of the PPCR in the Republic of Tajikistan are focused on hydraulic power industry, development of other renewable sources of energy, agriculture and forestry, adequate response to and risk reduction against natural disasters, provision of hydrometerological services, as well as measures to raise public awareness.</p>

<td><p>The representatives of all key ministries and agencies, branches of the economy and the general public took part in the process of preparation and discussion of the INDC. In the Republic of Tajikistan, the programmes, strategies and legislative instruments are in place or being elaborated, aimed at developing renewable sources of energy, energy saving and energy efficiency, reforming agriculture, modernizing industry and transport, developing forestry and land use planning. In 2003, the National Action Plan of the Republic of Tajikistan on Climate Change Mitigation was adopted. At present, the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan until 2015 is being implemented. At the time of preparation of the INDC, the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan (2030), National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and other sectoral strategies are being developed.</p>
<p>Taking into account the results of the negotiations and the decisions of COP-21 to the UNFCCC in Paris, December 2015, the Republic of Tajikistan may review or develop legislative and regulatory instruments; specify and complement sectoral strategies and action plans to reflect adequately the priority issues of climate change, as well as develop projects and programmes for ‘climate-sensitive’ investment and fulfillment of the intentions of the Republic of Tajikistan with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and climate adaptation, as outlined in this INDC.

<td><strong>Why the INDC is fair and ambitious, taking into account national peculiarities </strong></td>
<td>The Republic of Tajikistan has one of the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions but, in spite of a high share of renewable power generation, it faces acute power shortages against the background of the economy and population growth. Since 1991, at the initial stage of the period of state independence, and especially during the period 1992-2000, the Republic of Tajikistan had experienced grave consequences resulting from civil war and of the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy, with a sharp increase in poverty. During the period 2008-2015, the socio-economic indicators of the Republic of Tajikistan have improved. For the Republic of Tajikistan, the basic priority of climate measures lies in adaptation because of high dependence of the considerable part of the population and of the branches of the economy on climatic conditions, also taking into account the key role of the country’s mountain ecosystems in water resources generation and biological diversity for Central Asia. The existing assessed contribution of the Republic of Tajikistan to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 0.02%. In view of a low level of greenhouse gas emissions and a very high share of hydro-power (more than 90%), the level of greenhouse gas emissions of the Republic of Tajikistan will amount to 80-90% by 2030, as compared to 1990 (as stated in the INDC); this will ensure the achievement of socially acceptable and scientifically grounded indicators, both in absolute and per capita terms. By doing so, the Republic of Tajikistan adheres to the basic principle of the UNFCCC – common but differentiated responsibility – and expects an adequate level of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from economically developed countries and the largest countries-emitters of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC scientific recommendations to prevent global warming of more than 2°С. The international support of the intentions of the Republic of Tajikistan with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and a full-scale implementation of climate adaptation and resilience measures will enable the country to be strongly on track to green economy and climate-resilient development. The forests and gardens in Tajikistan are of critical importance for the preservation of mountain ecosystems and biodiversity, improvement of the state of lands and prevention of their further degradation, protection of vulnerable infrastructure, protection of water resources and carbon absorption from the atmosphere. That is why they play a specific role both in terms of mitigating the impact of anthropogenic activity on the climate and reducing negative consequences.</td>

<td><strong>How do the INDCs promote the achievement of the goal of the Convention, indicated in the Article 2 </strong></td>
<td>The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as compared to 1990, by its own and ongoing joint efforts, as well as at the expense of additional new funding and technology transfer on the part of the international community, will enable the country to take the path towards sustainable “green” development which is consistent with the Convention’s goal – to prevent global warming of more than 2°С. The achievement of such an ambitious goal is only possible by means of substantial and differentiated efforts of all countries that are in support of a new and ambitious climate agreement within the UNFCCC.</td>
