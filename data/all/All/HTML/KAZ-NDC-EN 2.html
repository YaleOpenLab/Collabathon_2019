<h1><a id="Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contribution__Submission_of_the_Republic_of_Kazakhstan_0"></a>Intended Nationally Determined Contribution - Submission of the Republic of Kazakhstan</h1>
<p>The Republic of Kazakhstan is fully committed to the UNFCCC negotiation process with a view to adopting a global legally binding agreement applicable to all parties at the Paris Conference in December 2015, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that global temperature rise does not exceed 2°C.</p>
<p>The Republic of Kazakhstan wishes to communicate the following Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), and intends to achieve an economy-wide <strong>target of 15%-25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.</strong> In line with the Lima Call for Climate Action, the following quantifiable information is hereby submitted:</p>

<td>Net contribution of international market based mechanisms</td>
<td>Kazakhstan supports inclusion of market based mechanisms in the 2015 agreement, and the opportunity to use carbon units recognised by the UNFCCC. Kazakhstan retains the option of using market based mechanisms under the UNFCCC. Kazakhstan will consider adequately discounting international units for compliance to ensure a contribution to net global emission reductions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Planning Process</td>
<td>Kazakhstan’s long term objectives is to become one of the 30 most developed countries in the world by 2050. Following a path of low carbon economy growth Kazakhstan adopted the law “On energy saving and energy efficiency”, “On Supporting the Use of Renewable Energy Sources” aiming at greater use of renewable energy sources. In order to emphasize its commitment to low carbon growth, Kazakhstan has adopted a Concept on transition to a «Green» Economy. For the implementation of the Concept, an action is developed, under which government programs on waste management, modernisation of housing and communal services, development of sustainable transport, conservation of ecosystems and enhancement of forest cover were adopted. The laws on extended responsibility of entrepreneurs and greening of vehicles are being formulated. The implementation of the «Green» Economy Concept, and adoption of related legislative acts, should lead to modernisation of key infrastructure and production technologies based on energy-efficient technologies, and will make a significant contribution to reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases.</td>

<tr>
<td>Fair and ambitious targets, taking into account national circumstances</td>
<td>The target set represents a significant progression beyond the pledge of a 7% emission reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to the 1990 base year. This target is ambitious, as Kazakhstan has undergone a period of consistent growth from 2000 – 2010 during which GDP growth reached 8.3%. GDP growth during this period has always exceeded that of the world average. Under a revised and conservative business as usual scenario which takes into account potentially lower GDP growth rates the target proposed by Kazakhstan amounts to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to BAU projected emissions. Under favourable economic conditions and an increase in oil prices, the unconditional target proposed by Kazakhstan would amount to a 34% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to BAU projected emissions. The ambitiousness and fairness of the statement are concluded by the current emissions of Kazakhstan that reached 80-85% from 1990. At the same time the aim of the government’s economic policy of Kazakhstan is faster growth of GDP per capita to reach the current level of development of the countries of the OECD by 2030.</td>

<tr>
<td>How the INDC contributes to achieving the ultimate objective of the Convention (Article 2)</td>
<td>Recognizing the reality and taking responsibility, Kazakhstan intends to contribute to international efforts to combat climate change. The reduction or stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 at 85% of emissions level in 1990 (absolute target) or more ambitious goal of reducing the overall, national emissions by 25% (conditional target), is a rather challenging target in economic and financial sense, achievement of which, among other things, should not lead to socio-economic tensions. The objectives set, will contribute to sustainable economic development and enable Kazakhstan to enter the path of low-carbon “green” development, and contribute to the achievement of the longterm global goal – to keep increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius.</td>
