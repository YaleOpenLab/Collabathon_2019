<p>"Paraguay is a competitive country, one of the most efficient food producers in the world, with strong and innovative industries that employ skilled labor, a supplier of products and services with technology, towards a knowledge economy; With social development indexes in the highest range of South America; Connected and open to neighbors and the world; Environmentally and economically sustainable; With high levels of legal and citizen security; With attention to indigenous peoples, a strong role for women; With visionary and trained youths leading the country; With a democratic, supportive, subsidiary, transparent State, and that promotes equality of opportunity. Through a broad alliance between an Open Government, socially responsible private companies, and an active civil society”</p>
<p>Paraguay, is a Mediterranean country with almost seven million inhabitants that had the highest economic growth in all of Latin America in the last 30 years. In recent years the country has been betting to position itself as an attractive place for investments and is developing orderly policies throughout the country. It is a country that has innumerable natural resources and the production of clean energy is one of the most important activities of the country, as well as a growing agricultural development with a production system based almost entirely by conservation agriculture or direct sowing system And a growing cattle ranch with highly profitable markets that require the country to make greater efforts in the production of food for the world.</p>
<p>Paraguay has abundant energy, clean and renewable, which places it as the leading net global exporter of electricity. It shares with Brazil the Itaipú Hydroelectric, which is a world power in the production of this type of energy.</p>
<p>Since 1973, it has a Forestry Law that obliges landowners to keep twenty-five percent of their natural forest area, and in case of not having this minimum percentage, the owner must reforest an area equivalent to five percent of the area. Surface of the property. In addition, in the Chaco Biosphere Reserve, owners must own at least fifty percent of the area with minimal anthropogenic alterations, or in natural conditions, and preferably carry out activities aimed at maintaining Environmental Services.</p>
<p>Paraguay has approximately 18,500,000 hectares of forest (FRA, FAO 2005) representing 45% of the total area of ​​the country, giving us a value of 2.9 hectares of forest per capita.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the country has made important progress in the macroeconomic aspect, with solid results in the fiscal, monetary and with the initiation of important social reforms. With these measures, poverty and extreme poverty were reduced in this 15-year period in line with economic growth.</p>
<p>In order to respond to the economic and social challenges, the Government of Paraguay has developed a National Development Plan (PND) for the period 2014-2030, where our country vision is expressed to 2030. The National Development Plan is organized around three pillars Thematic areas: (i) poverty reduction and social development; (Ii) inclusive economic growth, and Iii) insertion of Paraguay in international markets. It also relies on a medium-term economic framework that provides for sustainable fiscal policies, improvements in tax collection initiatives, greater effectiveness of social protection policies and their targeting, and broader financial inclusion.</p>
<p>The contributions of Paraguay are adjusted to present national circumstances and the long-term objectives set out in the National Development Plan, as well as support in financing and international technological cooperation. Paraguay is a country that has expressed its desire to contribute positive actions to reduce the adverse effects of climate change, and this plan includes strategic aspects related to climate change for both mitigation and adaptation</p>
<p>Within the National Development Plan of Paraguay there are many economic, social and environmental objectives and the ones that are linked to climate change are the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient multimodal transport</li>
<li>Effective control of deforestation</li>
<li>Increase revenues from carbon sales</li>
<li>GDP growth of 6.8% per year.</li>
<li>Increase national revenues from the sale of environmental services (credits for carbon sinks).</li>
<li>Increase coverage of forest areas and protected biomass (% of forest cover and% weighted by global biomass).</li>
<li>Increase the consumption of renewable energies by 60% (share in the energy matrix).</li>
<li>Reduce fossil fuel consumption by 20% (share in the energy matrix).</li>
<li>Increased efficiency in agricultural production systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding lines of action will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a sustainable energy matrix.</li>
<li>Incorporate technologies for the exploitation of new sources of sustainable energy (including solar, wind, biomass).</li>
<li>Promote the sustainable management of forest ecosystems and promote reforestation activities for protection and income generation and reduction of the process of loss and degradation of native forests.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this last year, Paraguay has demonstrated its commitments in the climate and environmental aspects since it has presented a National Plan of Forestation and Reforestation, where through a presidential decree the Vice Ministry of Mines and Energy is authorized to establish certification and funding regimes to the National Development Bank of US $ 40,000,000 for the beginning of forest plantations for energy and timber purposes, which will directly affect the lower pressure on native forests for the use of biomass.</p>
<p>Paraguay also published its National Plan for Climate Change - Phase 1 - Mitigation Strategy, which describes the national priorities regarding this line of action, and has focused its efforts on mainstreaming actions related to the mitigation of adverse effects of climate change, in order to articulate strategies for its effective implementation.</p>
<p><img src="PRY-1.png" width="360" height="360" /></p>
<p>Paraguay is a country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change variability. Adaptation is an essential element to adjust to these climate changes in order to moderate the damage. The scarce information and lack of strategies on how to deal with the impacts of climate change causes environmental, social, health and economic problems; it is therefore necessary to direct action plans towards adaptation, which include the participation of all possible actors.</p>
<p>Based on the common but differentiated responsibilities of each country as mentioned in Article Four of the UNFCCC commitments, where national and regional development priorities are focused according to their national circumstances. And where the same article states that in implementing commitments, the specific needs and concerns of developing country parties arising from the adverse effects of climate change or the impact of the implementation of response measures must be addressed, In particular from some countries "among which they mention landlocked countries".</p>
<p>Therefore, the following pages describe Paraguay's national contributions, which means that our country sets ambitious and fair targets to avoid emissions of 429 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. During the period of implementation of this action plan, and from 2030 to avoid emissions for a total of 83 MtCO<sub>2</sub>eq. On an annual basis, established according to the projected development calculations in the existing studies.</p>
