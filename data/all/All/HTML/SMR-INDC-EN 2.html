<h2><a id="Submission_of_San_Marino_to_the_ADP_4"></a>Submission of San Marino to the ADP</h2>
<p>San Marino, 30 September 2015</p>
<h2><a id="San_Marinos_Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contribution_7"></a>San Marino’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution</h2>
<h3><a id="Introduction_9"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Republic of San Marino, as a party of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is fully committed to the negotiating process aimed at reaching a global legally binding agreement applicable to all Parties at the Paris Conference in December 2015 in line with keeping global warming below 2°C.</p>
<p>San Marino hereby communicates its intended nationally determined contribution and the accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, with reference to decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.</p>
<h3><a id="Intended_Nationally_Determined_Contributions_INDC_14"></a>Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)</h3>
<p>The Republic of San Marino, on the basis of the decision of the Government held on 28 September 2015, commits to reduce GHG emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>In line with the Lima Call for Climate Action, in particular paragraph 14, the Republic of San Marino shall submit the following information for its INDC.</p>
<h3><a id="Information_to_facilitate_clarity_transparency_and_understanding_20"></a>Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding</h3>
<p><em>Quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year):</em><br>
Base year: 2005<br>
Emissions in base year: 0,213 Mt per year (provisional, will be defined through the next inventory submissions).</p>
<p><em>Time frames and/or periods for implementation</em>:<br>
Time frame of the commitment is until end 2030. This quantified commitment will be translated into a progressive commitment over the period.</p>
<p><em>Scope and coverage:</em><br>
Gases covered: all greenhouse gasses not controlled by the Montreal Protocol: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, HFCs, PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub></p>
<p>Sectors covered: energy; industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land-use, land-use change and forestry; waste.</p>
<p>San Marino supports the inclusion of international aviation and shipping on the basis of future internationally agreed rules applicable to all parties.</p>
<p><em>Net Contribution of International Market Based Mechanisms:</em><br>
The Republic of San Marino intends to achieve its goals of reducing emissions exclusively through domestic measures. However, the use of international mechanisms based on the market is not excluded if domestic reductions will prove insufficient to achieve the targets set.</p>
<p><em>Planning processes:</em><br>
Since 2008 environmental policies have been implemented with a view to improving energy performance of buildings, production of electricity from renewable sources, energy consumption reduction. Moreover, a virtuous policy has been undertaken in waste management, reduction of solvent emissions into the atmosphere and application of new technologies in agriculture and land use including through a more careful territorial planning.</p>
<p>These policies will continue to be implemented in the coming years.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions and methodological approach:</em><br>
Metric Applied Global Warming Potential on a 100 year timescale in accordance with the IPCC’s2th Assessment Report.<br>
Methodologies for Estimating Emissions: IPCC Guidelines 1996, IPCC Guidelines 2006 and IPCC 2013 KP Supplement.</p>
<p><em>Fairness and ambitions of the INDC:</em><br>
San Marino contribution to global emissions is 0,00052%. Nevertheless, San Marino undertakes to achieve a reduction of emissions in line with the goal of keeping global warming below 2° C.<br>
The population country is still increasing, 10% in the last 10 years. This increase has a consequence on the energy consumption.</p>
<h3><a id="National_Circumstances_51"></a>National Circumstances</h3>
<p>With an area of 61.19 km<sup>2</sup> and a population of about 32,500 inhabitants, the Republic of San Marino is one of the smallest and least populous countries in the world. Its territory includes about 10 km<sup>2</sup> of woods and 28.6 km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural areas. It is located in Southern Europe and is an enclave in central Italy.</p>
<p>The Republic of San Marino ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 5 July 1994 and the Kyoto Protocol on 21 January 2010, as a non- Annex I country without quantified commitments for reducing the GHG emissions. Furthermore, San Marino accepted the Doha Amendment on 20 July 2015.</p>
<p>San Marino economy is based on small- and medium-sized enterprises. Tourism is thriving, with over 2 million tourists every year. The country has a modest agricultural sector, which offers high quality and genuine products and a well-diversified banking and financial sector. In 2013, the GDP of the Republic of San Marino was equal to 1,357.1 million euro, corresponding to 40.462 euro per inhabitant.</p>
<p>In 2014 the country’s energy needs were equal to 259 GWh of electricity and 45 Gg of fuels. The Republic of San Marino is totally dependent on energy imports since it has neither fossil fuel sources nor energy production plants.</p>
<p>The small territory of San Marino has a limit access to renewable energy options such as hydroelectric, wind or geothermal power. As a consequence, in the last years, the Government of San Marino has promoted the development of solar energy, in particular solar PV, throughout forms of incentives, benefits and bonuses.</p>
