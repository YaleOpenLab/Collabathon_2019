<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>At the nineteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties held in Warsaw, decision 1 / CP.19, means to continue the implementation of the Durban Platform, was adopted, providing in paragraph 2 (B) that, in view of its determination to adopt, at its twenty-first session (December 2015), a protocol, another legal instrument or a mutually agreed text having legal force, developed under the Convention and applicable To all Parties, and in order for this instrument to enter into force and be applied from 2020, to invite all Parties to initiate or expand internal preparations for their planned nationally determined contributions (CPDN) <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, without prejudice to The legal nature of the said contributions, with a view to the adoption of a protocol, another legal instrument or a mutually agreed text having legal force, drawn up under the Convention and applicable to all Parties, with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in Article 2 of the Convention and to make it available well before the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (by the first quarter of 2015). Parties willing to do so) in a manner that would enhance the clarity, transparency and understanding of the proposed contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of such contributions.</p>
<p>This invitation to all Parties to communicate their determined contributions at the national level in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (for the first quarter of 2015 by Parties willing to do so) in a manner that Facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the CPDNs, was reiterated at the Conference of the Parties held in Lima, through paragraph 13 of decision 1 / CP.20.</p>
<p>Following the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen in December 2009 (COP15), the Principality of Andorra has shown its willingness to accede to the Convention. On 2 March 2011, the country acceded to the Convention as a Party not included in Annex I (non-Annex I)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> .</p>
<p>In this regard, Andorra is pleased to communicate the planned contributions, determined at the national level, in accordance with decisions 1 / CP.19 and 1 / CP.20.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-commitment">Description of Commitment</h2>
<p>Commitments to reduce unabsorbed emissions are the result of Andorra's first biennial report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2014). For 2030, the predicted contributions determined at the national level (CPDN) of Andorra are in line with the evolution of the representative channel of the RCP2.6 concentrations, compatible with the maintenance of the increase in the global temperature below 2°C in the 21st century compared to the values ​​from 1850 to 1900 and consistent with a scenario with strict mitigation measures and the maintenance of global concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> eq. In the range 430-480 ppm. These commitments result in a reduction of equivalent unabsorbed emissions of 37% (193.73 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq) compared to the unabsorbed emissions of the business as usual scenario, based on Andorra's First Biennial Report to the Convention The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (December 2014), by 2030</p>

<p>The commitment of the Parties must be in accordance with their responsibility, their capacities and the support received from the international community. In this direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andorra is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as a Party not included in Annex I (non-Annex I). At the international level, Andorra is responsible in 2010 for approximately 0.00112% (547.43 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.) Of global emissions<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>, which tends to decline, with a reduction between 2000 and 2010 of 21%.</li>
<li>The country has grown substantially since 1990, with a population growth of + 56% (between 1990 and 2010) and economic growth of + 50% in terms of real GDP over the same period (+ 73% Refers to 1990-2005). This increase has had a direct impact on energy consumption, particularly in the areas of building heating the average temperature of Andorra is 4.9ºC (1950-2010)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>, with an average altitude of 2,044 meters on sea level and road transport - all internal displacements are carried out by means of the national road network<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>. Compared to 1990 emissions, Andorra increased its emissions by + 28% (2011), comparable to the increase in global emissions + 29% (2010)</li>
<li>Despite these developments, Andorra's emissions have shown a clear downward trend since 2005 (-9.6% between 2005 and 2010), contrary to what is observed at a global level with an increase of more than 4.3% For the same period (see Figure 1). Annual relative emissions are also below the world average with, for 2010, 4.8513<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> eq. Per capita, and 211.11 14 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> eq. Per M € (real GDP).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>

Figure 1. Andorra's contribution (black) and evolution of the global emissions index and country (blue)</p>
<ul>
<li>Although Andorra's responsibility for emissions at the global level is extremely limited, the effects of climate change are already being perceived. The climate has already evolved with an upward temperature trend of around + 0.20ºC / decade for average values ​​and annual rainfall experiencing a drop of at least 45mm / decade (1950-2012). These variations will undoubtedly result in impacts on water resources and on snow cover, the fundamental basis of one of the pillars of the Andorran economy: tourism linked to winter sports. Climate change will undoubtedly have impacts far beyond these areas. Health, natural hazards, hydropower production, agriculture, biodiversity, are clear examples of their vulnerability to the phenomenon</li>
<li>According to Andorra's First Biennial Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2014), the road transport sector is the largest contributor to the GHG inventory of Andorra, with 49.4% of GHG emissions and removals (in absolute values) for all inventory years. The sectors other sectors, liquid fuels (commercial / institutional and residential heating) and forest land that continue as forest land, with 21.6% and 19.2%, respectively, follow the transport sector by far. These three categories account for 90.3% of all inventories in the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2011.</li>
<li>The mitigation policies associated with the sectors mentioned relate to long-term actions, with limited profitability and short-term results.</li>
<li>For 2030, Andorran's nationally determined planned contributions (CPDN) are in line with the evolution of the representative channel of the RCP2.6 concentrations of the scenario with strict mitigation measures and the maintenance of global concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> eq. In the range of 430-480 ppm (see Table 1 and Figure 2), a necessary condition for maintaining a temperature below 2ºC in the 21st century (compared to the period 1850-1900), with a certain degree of certainty (Likely, 66% -100%).</li>
<li>At the global level, the conditions necessary to ensure an increase in temperatures below the 2ºC mark in the 21st century (relative to the period 1850-1900) will be maintained for 2050 if the emissions compared to 2010 are reduced by between 41 and 72%, and 78 to 118% in 2100<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>

<p>No international support to date for the implementation of mitigation or adaptation actions.</p>
<p>Andorra requested and received in April 2013 the support of an external consultant appointed by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to identify country-specific circumstances, the steps to be taken (documentation, Deadlines, etc.) and possible funding channels. In line with this technical assistance, in early 2014, the country submitted a financing proposal to the Global Environment Facility for the preparation of the first biennial report (BUR1) and the first national communication (NC1), which received no reply to date (March 2015). It should be recalled that paragraph 44 of decision 2 / CP.17 urged the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to provide funds to support non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their first biennial Updated as soon as possible in 2012 and on the basis of full funding of the agreed costs</p>
