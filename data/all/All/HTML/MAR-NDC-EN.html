<h2><a id="NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_UNDER_THE_UNFCCC_1"></a>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE UNFCCC</h2>
<h3><a id="Introduction_3"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Morocco’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is an improved version of the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) that Morocco presented to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on June 5, 2015. Although Morocco is responsible for only a small share of the problem of climate change, it developed its NDC with the conviction that the global ambition to counter the effects of climate change calls for a commitment from all parties with regard to mitigation and adaptation, as well as means of implementation, cooperative approaches and transparency. As a result, in compliance with Article 3 of the Paris Agreement, Morocco’s NDC presents the kingdom’s efforts to combat climate change across all of the aforementioned themes.</p>
<h3><a id="Moroccos_National_Circumstances_5"></a>Morocco’s National Circumstances</h3>
<p>Located on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, at the gates of Europe and northern Africa, Morocco has always been a crossroads of civilizations. In recent decades, Morocco has experienced substantial economic and social development within the context of climate change that has an impact on all sectors. Consequently, the pressure on natural resources has increased, affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems and the agriculture sector, particularly because of water scarcity. Water availability per capita was over three times higher in 1960 (approximately 2,600 m<sup>3</sup> per capita per year) than it is today (approximately 700 m<sup>3</sup> per capita per year).</p>
<p>Aware of this situation, Morocco has voluntarily and resolutely engaged in a process to combat global warming, progressively outlining its own vision while complying with decisions taken collectively at the international level.</p>
<h3><a id="Moroccos___Vision__on__Climate_Change_10"></a>Morocco’s Vision on Climate Change</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Make its territory and civilization more resilient to climate change while ensuring a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy.</em></strong><br>
</blockquote>
This political will is today embodied by the kingdom’s 2011 Constitution, which gave it a new impetus by enshrining sustainable development as a right for all citizens, and by instituting new instruments of democratic governance, a condition to achieving sustainable development across the country. This political will is further enshrined in the Framework Law on the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development (NCESD), which asserts “the rights and duties inherent to the environment and sustainable development accorded to natural and legal persons and proclaims these principles to be respected by the state, local authorities and public institutions and businesses.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> The operationalization of the charter was undertaken through the preparation of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD), which will guide the actions of all public institutions and private actors in furthering social and economic development that is both sustainable and dynamic.</p>
<p>Morocco’s NDC finds its institutional roots in the NSSD and outlines a vision of Morocco in 2030. As a result, the implementation of Morocco’s NDC is part of an integrated approach that goes beyond climate change, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respect for human rights and gender equality, as enshrined in Morocco’s 2011 Constitution.</li>
<li>Synergies with the two other Rio conventions, which aim to restore, respect and maintain biological diversity and the integrated management of water resources and sustainable land management in order to combat desertification and land degradation.</li>
<li>Alignment of actions related to climate change with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially goals 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 17.</li>
<li>Implementation of the advanced regionalization project in Morocco, building on integrated and participatory strategic land planning. This project will substantially contribute to implementing Morocco’s NDC through a national vision for land planning that promotes regional potentials and resources along with solidarity between regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Morocco has the conviction that significant and unprecedented engagement from Moroccan actors is required, notably those in the financial sector who have the ability to influence investment flows and their peers engaged in international finance.</p>
<p>To promote this engagement from stakeholders at different levels, Morocco has established the Moroccan Competence Centre for Climate Change (4C Maroc),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> a capacity-building and information-sharing platform on climate change. The platform is available to various stakeholders and has a regional and African outreach. The Mosaïcc portal<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> was also established as a result of a partnership between national and international institutions. The portal strives to build capacity around adaptation to climate change in the agricultural, water and forestry sectors. The 4C Maroc and the Mosaïcc portals will be the drivers of this engagement.</p>
<h3><a id="Development_Process_28"></a>Development Process</h3>
<p>In developing its NDC, Morocco undertook a broad, two-year stakeholder consultation process. During this process, Morocco reviewed the policies and programs that are being implemented to combat global warming and determined how ambitious the country wants to be in its NDC.</p>
<p>The process for developing its INDC culminated in a national conference, held on June 2, 2015, in Rabat and chaired by the head of government, to officially present the draft INDC to all Moroccan stakeholders. Consultations held after the adoption of the Paris Agreement strengthened the foundations of the NDC, and enabled a renewal of stakeholder engagement by ensuring their full support for the implementation of the commitments included in the present document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Morocco’s Commitment: Key Takeaways</strong><br>
Morocco, moved by its deeply held convictions of common but differentiated responsibility, by its belief in a common human destiny and its commitment to the principle of equity, strives to outline the path to a global, responsible and fair pledge for the well-being of our planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Owing to Morocco’s high vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, Morocco ought to first minimize the risks of these impacts and invest in adaptation compared to mitigation actions. Morocco has made important strides in matters of adaptation since its independence in 1956. Between 2005 and 2010, the kingdom dedicated <strong>64 % of its total climate spending to adaptation efforts</strong>, a value equivalent to 9 % of its total investment spending.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The proportion of Morocco’s national budget dedicated to adaptation is a testimony to the scale of the challenge facing Moroccan society. Efforts will have to increase over the coming years and decades. As an example, Morocco forecasts that, between 2020 and 2030, the implementation of adaptation programs will cost at a <strong>minimum USD 35 billion</strong> for the most vulnerable sectors, namely water, forestry and agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With regards to mitigation, Morocco’s GHG emission reduction targets will be achieved through economy-wide actions. Coordination of mitigation targets stemming from all sectoral strategies and all action plans will fall under the auspices of a low-carbon development strategy, which is currently being drafted. Numerous sectors will be addressed by these plans and strategies, namely energy, agriculture, transportation, water, waste, forestry, industry, housing and infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Morocco commits to <strong>reducing its GHG emissions by 42 % below businessas- usual (BAU)</strong> levels by 2030. This commitment will only be made possible if Morocco gains access to new sources of finance and to additional support relative to support received in recent years. This commitment leads to a total reduction of 527 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e) between 2020 and 2030. The total cost to reach this goal is USD 50 billion, of which USD 24 billion would be conditional on international support made available through new climate finance mechanisms, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="MOROCCO_NATIONALLY_DETERMINED_CONTRIBUTION_RELATIVE_TO_MITIGATION_44"></a>MOROCCO NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO MITIGATION</h3>
<p>In terms of mitigation, Morocco has set a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target of 42 % below BAU emissions by 2030, which can only be reached under the condition of benefitting from substantial support from the international community. Morocco also commits to an unconditional reduction target of 17 % below BAU levels by 2030, taking into account reductions in Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU).</p>
<p>These GHG emission reduction targets will be achieved by measures taken in all sectors of the economy. Coordination of mitigation targets stemming from all sectoral strategies and all action plans will fall under the auspices of a low-carbon development strategy, which is currently being drafted. Numerous sectors will be targeted by these plans and strategies, namely energy, agriculture, transportation, water, waste, forestry, industry, housing and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Morocco’s GHG mitigation goals rely in large part on an important transformation of the country’s energy sector. This transformation is driven by great political will. It aims to reduce the country’s heavy reliance on foreign energy sources and increase the share of renewable energy, while responding to growing demand for energy to ensure the socioeconomic development and well-being of its citizens. The primary goals that underlie this energy transition are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reaching over 52 % of installed electricity production capacity from renewable sources by 2030.</li>
<li>Reducing energy consumption by 15 % by 2030.</li>
<li>Substantially reducing public fossil fuel subsidies, building on reforms already undertaken in recent years.</li>
<li>Substantially increasing the use of natural gas, through infrastructure projects allowing liquefied natural gas imports.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Planing_and_Implementation_117"></a>Planing and Implementation</h3>
<p>In recent years, Morocco has thoroughly reformed its institutional, legal and fiscal frameworks to enable the transition to a green economy. A good example of a fiscal reform is Morocco’s reduction of public subsidies to electricity and different petroleum products, such as industrial fuels and gasoline, a move that creates a more attractive environment for investments in renewable energy and the rationing of energy consumption. In addition, institutional reform is underway, which, for example, expands the mandate of the Morocco Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN) to include the development of all renewable energy from all sources.</p>
<p>The implementation of Morocco’s NDC is based on several laws, strategies and national action plans, including the low-carbon development strategy, which takes its targets from the NDC, as well as clear and ambitious sectorial targets (see Table 2). For reference, Annex 1 presents the portfolio of actions used to estimate Morocco’s mitigation Contribution by 2030 and those Morocco plans to implement under its Contribution. It follows that 55 actions, of which 20 are AFOLU actions, spanning across all sectors, have been identified to define the mitigation scenario that leads to the conditional target, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Key sectoral strategies, along with their respective targets for the implementation of Morocco’s Contribution, are outlined in Table 2.</p>

 <li>Achieving the conditional target would mean that Morocco’s per capita emissions would not exceed 2.6 t CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030, including AFOLU (3 t CO<sub>2</sub>e per capita without AFOLU actions) and the GHG intensity in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would improve by 4.1 % over the period 2010–2030.</li>

<h2><a id="MOROCCO_ADAPTATION_COMMUNICATION_154"></a>MOROCCO ADAPTATION COMMUNICATION</h2>
<h3><a id="Moroccos_Vulnerability_to_Climate_Change_155"></a>Morocco’s Vulnerability to Climate Change</h3>
<p>Morocco is among the Mediterranean and African regions that have been exposed to the impacts of climate change for several decades now. In Morocco, the impacts of climate change take the form of a reduction in precipitation and snow cover, and a general rise in temperatures across the country.</p>
<p>Historically, Morocco went through 20 years of drought in the past 70 years, which means almost one third of that period. Studies show that in the future, Morocco will become more arid due to a decrease in precipitation, a concurrent temperature increase, and extreme weather events occurring with higher frequency. Projections show that the country’s decrease in precipitation will be to the order of 20 % on a 2050-time horizon, with a greater impact in semi-arid plains. Morocco’s Third Communication to the UNFCCC, submitted in 2016, offers an exhaustive status report of Morocco’s vulnerability to climate change, and of the adaptation actions underway.</p>
<p>Morocco is very vulnerable to climate change, due to its geographical location, and is prone to water scarcity, declining agricultural production, desertification, flooding and rising sea levels. Thanks to the kingdom’s great efforts with regards to human development, poverty in all forms has largely been eradicated in urban centers and has been greatly reduced in rural areas due to an increase in people’s living standards and efforts to reduce social disparities. However, these efforts are at risk of being counteracted by climate change’s negative impacts on the domestic economy and communities, including in rural areas. Thus, for Morocco, adaptation to climate change is the cornerstone of any program or policy on sustainable development. Some economic sectors or ecosystems are more sensitive than others to climate change, namely water, agriculture, fisheries, shorelines, forestry and health. For other sectors and ecosystems, a shortcoming of readily available data means that it is not currently available to provide a detailed description of their sensitivities.</p>
<p><em>Water Sector Vulnerability</em><br>
In Morocco, water sources entirely dependent on precipitation are very vulnerable to the spatial and temporal climate variability, as well as climate change. Since the 1980s, these sources have faced the negative impacts of climate change and an increase in demand from resident and economic sectors, and have decreased substantially as a result. Morocco is one of the countries with the smallest volume of water per capita. Water potential is estimated to be 22 billion m3 annually, or water availability that is less than 700 m3/capita/year, for a population of 33.9 million people. Despite a considerable effort in the construction of hydraulic structures and access to unconventional resources, this quantity could fall to 500 m3 by 2030 due to the impacts of climate change, population growth and a growth in economic activity. Forecasts conducted on certain water basins indicate that water available to residents will decrease to the level of water shortage by 2050. Water sector vulnerability will be affected by the increasing costs of action, and the aging and deteriorating quality of surface and underground resources. Conventional water resources will no longer be enough to fulfill the needs of the citizens and of the various socioeconomic sectors. It has become necessary for Morocco to develop unconventional water resources (such as water desalination, demineralization of brackish water, recycling treated wastewater and harvesting rainwater).</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Agricultural Sector</em><br>
The agricultural sector is a central part of the Moroccan economy, having contributed more than 14 % to national accounts and employed over 39 % of the country’s labor force between 2008 and 2013. A large part of lands used for agriculture are not irrigated, making the sector vulnerable to climate change. Several years of droughts spanning over the last decades have affected the agricultural sector’s main types of crops — and thus the economy — and community living standards, including in rural areas. In addition, the geographic area where multiple arboreal species used for arboriculture are found has shrunk as a result of increasing temperatures. Numerous studies in Morocco have found that climate change will substantially affect irrigation capacities and crop yields, as well as the geographic area in which fruit trees and crops important for food security can grow. Climate change will hasten the degradation of natural resources essential to agriculture, notably water, soils and agricultural biodiversity. In addition, rangelands, which cover 82 % of the country’s arid land, are already facing a degradation of plant breeding resources, as a result of both anthropogenic and climate factors. This increasing desertification is having a negative impact on feedstock levels. Climate change is expected to increase the desertification of these lands, and increase degradation and accelerate the loss of yields in fragile, mountainous areas, in oasis ecosystems, and argan trees, which are already in decline. These ecosystems are vital to subsistence for at-risk populations, the protection of natural resources and the fight against desertification.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Maritime Fisheries Sector</em><br>
The maritime fisheries sector contributes up to 2.3 % of Morocco’s GDP and directly or indirectly employs 660,000 people. It sustains 3 million people and makes up 15 % of total Moroccan exports, or 59 % of agri-food exports. Despite imprecise predictions, the sector is seen as one of the most vulnerable to climate change. The vulnerability stems from “upwelling” zones (which have a high fish density), sensitivities to climate change and the limited economic capacity of the affected communities. Climate change presents additional challenges, direct and indirect, to ocean and coastal ecosystems that are often already made fragile by other anthropogenic effects. The consequences of climate change, in addition to human activity, will affect the distribution and productivity of fish stocks, as well as the structure and productivity of certain ecosystems and their species’ populations. In Morocco, certain impacts of climate change, coupled with the overexploitation of fisheries resources, are already visible in the shift of mating periods, the migration and disappearance of certain species, the rising average temperature of marine waters, the reduction of the number of days amenable to fishing due to increases in flooding and storms, and the reduction of previously very abundant stocks.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Coastline</em><br>
Morocco has 3,500 km of coastline along the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Climate change will lead to an increase in flooding, the erosion of sand coastlines, and loos of coastal biodiversity and marine submersion. Because the vast majority of industrial, urban and tourist activity is clustered around coastal cities, climate change could impede the country’s socioeconomic development and lead to consequential environmental impacts in the absence of countervailing measures. Numerous beaches along both the Mediterranean and Atlantic shorelines have already faced severe erosion or have entirely disappeared, despite measures taken by public powers. Sea-level rise may submerge half of the land area of beaches by 2050 and 72 % of their area by 2100, and 187,400 people could be affected by flooding due to sea-level rise.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Forestry Sector</em><br>
Forest ecosystems serve an important purpose for the country and the lives of vulnerable populations. They play a crucial role in the socioeconomic development of rural and mountain areas, including some of the most remote areas of the country. A great anthropogenic stress is induced on these ecosystems, a stress that Morocco strives to bring back to levels cognizant to their production capacity, through a participative approach with local communities. Forest ecosystems in Morocco are already witnessing the impacts of climate change, such as the sporadic decay of certain Middle Atlas cedar trees. Other imminent risks include more frequent and more severe wildfires, and phytosanitary problems stemming from the emergence of new pests. Climate change will have an impact on how vibrant and dynamic forest ecosystems are, on their ability to regenerate and to adapt to regular climate fluctuations, their biodiversity (both of their fauna and flora), their consistency, and their spatial distribution. Climate change will also induce catastrophic impacts on current key ecological balances knowing that extremely crucial orographic ranges make up parts of the country’s geography. Climate change will increase the risk that the surface area of some forest ecosystems (cedar trees, cork oak, cypress trees, argan trees, and others) shrinks and makes way for preforest, steppes, and desert ecosystems, which will have concomitant impacts both in terms of socioeconomic dynamics and in terms losses of ecosystem services.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Health Secto</em>r<br>
Vulnerability to climate change of the health sector is explained by the presence of endemic illnesses such as malaria, schistosomiasis, typhoid and cholera, likely to be made worse by climate change. Even though resources are dedicated to combat the spread of these illnesses, resurgence as a result of the impacts of climate change is possible. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), climate change would increase deaths in Morocco by 250,000 annually between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat-related stress. According climate change scenarios, the vector capacity of the dengue virus would increase from 0.29 to 0.33 in 2070 relative to a reference value of 0.22. Diarrheal deaths attributed to climate change in children 15 and under would reach 10.5 %, or 1,600 deaths, in 2030. According to a high GHG emissions scenario, deaths in elderly populations as a result of heat should reach 50 for every 100,000 people by 2080, based on an estimated baseline of five deaths for every 100,000 people between 1961 and 1990. The impacts of climate change on agriculture will also disproportionally impact those most vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability of the Tourism Sector</em><br>
Morocco is world-class destination, owing to the riches of its heritage, its diverse landscape and its proximity to Europe, as well as its accommodation, transport and communications facilities. Tourism represents 12 % of Morocco’s GDP, and is a substantial contributor to wealth creation and poverty reduction. In 2015, approximately USD 6 billion in revenues were generated from non-residents who visited Morocco, covering for 32 % of the country’s trade balance deficit. Through Vision 2020, the tourism sector is striving to position Morocco as a benchmark with regards to sustainable development across the Mediterranean shorelines by targeting three areas: seaside resorts, culture and nature. Nonetheless, the tourism sector faces significant challenges that are stemming from climate change. Mainly, the sector is anticipating strenuous circumstances with regards to water scarcity, decreasing snowcap, degradation of fragile ecosystems, vulnerability of seaside infrastructure, extreme weather events and new diseases that may spread due to rising temperatures.</p>
<h3><a id="Moroccos_Vision_to_Address_the_Risks_of_Climate_Change_Impacts_183"></a>Morocco’s Vision to Address the Risks of Climate Change Impacts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Preserve its <strong>territory</strong> and its <strong>civilization</strong> in the most appropriate manner, effectively responding to the vulnerabilities of its territory and implementing an adaptation policy that builds resilience for all of its <strong>population</strong> and its <strong>economic actors</strong> to face these vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morocco implements a sectoral approach, adapted to the circumstances and specific features of the territorial entities: mountain regions, the coast, oases, agricultural areas and urban areas. Morocco’s ultimate objectives in addressing climate change, which must also resonate with the international community, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The protection of populations, through a risk-prevention management approach, linked to the exodus of rural populations and its socioeconomic consequences, particularly in the most vulnerable areas (coastal zones, mountainous areas, regions with a high propensity for desertification, and oases). This approach relies on an observation-and-research system to better understand current and future climate risks.</li>
<li>The protection of natural heritage, biodiversity, forestry and fishery resources, through an ecosystem-based adaptation approach. Morocco commits to restoring ecosystems and strengthening their resilience, to combat soil erosion and prevent flooding.</li>
<li>The protection of climate-sensitive production systems, such as agriculture and tourism, as well as high-risk infrastructure. Because water resources are the most constraining factor to sustainable economic and social development in Morocco, the kingdom has recently developed its National Water Strategy (NWS) and its National Water Plan (NWP) with the aim to improve integrated and appropriate water resource management, the development of unconventional water resources, preservation methods, the protection against pollution, training, scientific research and awareness around these themes.</li>
<li>The protection of the cultural heritage of the kingdom through education and awareness actions, and efforts to preserve ancestral good practices in highly vulnerable sectors, such as water and agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Objectives_to_Build_Resilience_191"></a>Objectives to Build Resilience</h3>
<p>Morocco’s vision for adaptation involves several quantified sectorial goals for 2020 and 2030, presented in Table 3. Even though Morocco already invests heavily in adaptation, reaching these targets will only be possible with significant support from the international community and creditors.</p>

<p>These strategies, plans, programs and initiatives set in motion numerous projects improving adaptation to climate change. In addition, Morocco is currently undergoing a process to elaborate its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and more broadly its NSSD, to improve its climate change resilience framework.</p>
<h3><a id="Moroccos_Adaptation_Finance_Needs_216"></a>Morocco’s Adaptation Finance Needs</h3>
<p>Adaptation needs will have significant budgetary implications for Morocco, for all sectors of the economy, and for the protection of human and animal health. Over the period 2005–2010, Morocco devoted 64 % of all climate-related spending in the country to adaptation, particularly in the water sector, which represents 9 % of overall investment expenditures. More specifically, investments planned to achieve the desired targets in the water, agricultural and forestry sectors are estimated at USD 2.5 billion. Securing the national roadway system against additional climate change-induced floods would cost 5 % more than traditional maintenance costs.</p>
<p>This considerable share of the national expenditures budget dedicated to adaptation demonstrates the magnitude of the challenges facing Moroccan society. And this share is certain to rise over time. Morocco expects to dedicate at least 15 % of its overall investment budgets to adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2030, Morocco estimates that the cost of implementation of adaptation projects for the water, forestry and agriculture sectors, the sectors most vulnerable to climate change, will at a minimum reach USD 35 billion.</p>
<p>Morocco is currently drafting its National Adaptation Plan, which will present and quantify measures for the adaptation to climate change. While awaiting the final plan, national priorities in this domain can be summarized as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving knowledge on climate change and the impacts of climate change, especially with regards to the most vulnerable strategic sectors.</li>
<li>Conserving water resources and securing water supply for both economic sectors and household needs.</li>
<li>Strengthening food security through natural resource conservation, intensifying sustainable agricultural practices, reducing poverty in rural areas, and tracking stocks and prices on food commodities on international markets.</li>
<li>Conserving fragile ecosystems: mountains, oases, the argan tree, pastoral lands, wetlands and coastal areas.</li>
<li>Protecting coastal areas from rising sea levels in order to safeguard households, as well as industrial and urban infrastructure.</li>
<li>Conserving forest resources by continuing reforestation efforts and fighting wildfires.</li>
<li>Strengthening adaptation of infrastructure against bad weather and future weather conditions.</li>
<li>Improving health and safety of the population, animals and crop production to protect from transmissible illnesses that thrive under climate change.</li>
<li>Continuing to improve the institutional and regulatory governance frameworks addressing climate change, as well as ensuring policies are consistent across sectors.</li>
<li>Building capacity with regards to developing, financing, implementing and monitoring climate change adaptation projects at the institutional and local levels (public, private and partnerships).</li>
<li>Promoting scientific research, research and development, innovation, as well as technology and knowledge transfer.</li>
<li>Developing early warning systems for climate events, and agro-meteorological systems for forecasting agricultural production.</li>
<li>Introducing academic curricula specializing in climate risk and climate change in training and learning institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, Morocco is seeking the support of the international community to implement these projects. Beyond financial support, Morocco expects to benefit from technical and institutional capacity building, particularly regarding the creation of data and knowledge sharing. It also expects to benefit from legal, financial and engineering support pertaining to designing and implementing projects at the regional and local levels, as well as for the monitoring and evaluation of their socioeconomic impacts.</p>
<h3><a id="Monitoring_and_Evaluation_System_for_Adaptation_in_Morocco_240"></a>Monitoring and Evaluation System for Adaptation in Morocco</h3>
<p>Morocco has put in place a system to monitor and assess vulnerability and adaptation to climate change that aims to provide the country’s regions with an institutional mechanism to monitor climate sensitivities and results stemming from adaptation actions, all the while taking gender issues into account. This pilot project was first tested in southern Moroccan regions. The adoption of the monitoring and evaluation system by other regions is planned for the medium term, with the implementation of a national governance mechanism to oversee the monitoring and evaluation system.</p>
<p><strong>Annex 1</strong><br>
This annex presents Morocco’s portfolio of mitigation actions for 2030 and has been used to estimate the kingdom’s NDC relative to mitigation. Morocco’s unconditional target will be reached thanks to the implementation of some of these actions. The annex is included for the sake of transparency in this approach, which strives to provide as much clarity as possible. Table A1 provides an overview of actions considered for implementation as part of the NDC.</p>
